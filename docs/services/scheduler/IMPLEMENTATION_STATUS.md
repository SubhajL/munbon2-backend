# Scheduler Service - Implementation Status

## Overview
The Weekly Batch Scheduler and Field Operations Mobile App have been implemented for Instance 17. This service optimizes irrigation schedules to minimize field team travel while coordinating with automated gates.

## Service Details
- **Port**: 3021
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Purpose**: Weekly schedule optimization and field team coordination

## Implemented Features

### 1. Scheduler Service (Task 60)

#### API Endpoints

- POST `/week/{week}/generate` - Generate optimized schedule
- PUT `/week/{week}/status` - Update schedule status
- GET `/current` - Get currently active schedule
- GET `/history` - Get schedule history
- POST `/operation/{operation_id}/complete` - Mark operation complete
- GET `/conflicts/{week}` - Check schedule conflicts

**Demand Processing (`/api/v1/scheduler/*`)**
- POST `/demands` - Submit water demands (from Instance 18)
- GET `/demands/week/{week}` - Get aggregated demands
- GET `/demands/status/{schedule_id}` - Check processing status
- POST `/demands/validate` - Pre-validate demands
- PUT `/demands/{demand_id}/priority` - Update demand priority
- GET `/demands/conflicts/{week}` - Get demand conflicts
- POST `/demands/aggregate/{week}` - Trigger aggregation

**Field Operations (`/api/v1/field-ops/*`)**
- GET `/instructions/{team}` - Get team instructions
- POST `/instructions/download/{team}` - Download offline package
- PUT `/operations/{operation_id}/report` - Submit operation report
- POST `/operations/{operation_id}/photo` - Upload photo
- POST `/teams/{team}/location` - Update team location
- GET `/teams/status` - Get all teams status
- POST `/sync` - Sync offline data
- GET `/gates/physical-markers` - Get gate marker mappings

### 2. Schedule Optimization Engine

**Features:**
- Multi-objective optimization using Tabu Search
- Minimizes field team travel distance
- Maximizes demand satisfaction
- Balances workload across teams/days
- Respects gravity flow constraints
- Travel time calculations using geodesic distance

**Constraints:**
- 1-2 field work days per week (Tuesday/Thursday)
- Maximum 20 gates per team per day
- Work hours: 7 AM - 5 PM
- Minimum 30 minutes per gate operation

### 3. Demand Aggregation

**Sources:**
- ROS/GIS Integration service (Instance 18)
- Historical demand patterns
- Weather-based adjustments
- Manual overrides

**Features:**
- Merges and deduplicates demands
- Applies weather adjustment factors
- Groups by zones and crop types
- Validates against system capacity

### 4. Mobile App Structure (Task 61)

**React Native App Features:**
- Offline-first architecture
- Redux store with persistence
- SQLite for offline storage
- GPS navigation to gates
- Photo capture capability
- Background sync service

**Key Screens Implemented:**
- Dashboard - Main hub showing progress and status
- Schedule - Today's operations list
- Navigation - GPS navigation to gates
- Gate Operation - Record gate adjustments
- Photo Capture - Take verification photos
- Sync - Manual data synchronization
- Settings - App configuration

### 5. Real-time Integration

**Flow Monitoring Integration:**
- Queries gate states from Instance 16
- Submits manual gate updates
- Verifies hydraulic feasibility

**Weather Integration:**
- Adjusts demands based on rainfall forecast
- Modifies priorities for drought conditions

## Testing

The service can be tested against:
- Mock server on port 3099
- Flow Monitoring service on port 3011
- ROS/GIS service on port 3041 (when available)

## Configuration

Environment variables required:
```env
# Service Configuration
SERVICE_NAME=scheduler
PORT=3021
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Database Connections
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/munbon
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/1

# External Services

```

## Mobile App Setup

```bash
cd mobile-apps/field-operations
npm install
npx react-native run-android
```

## Files Created

1. `/src/main.py` - FastAPI application
2. `/src/config/settings.py` - Configuration
3. `/src/api/schedule.py` - Schedule endpoints
4. `/src/api/demands.py` - Demand endpoints  
5. `/src/api/field_ops.py` - Field operations endpoints
6. `/src/services/schedule_optimizer.py` - Optimization engine
7. `/src/services/demand_aggregator.py` - Demand aggregation

## Key Achievements

1. **Optimization Algorithm**: Tabu Search metaheuristic minimizes travel while satisfying demands
2. **Offline Support**: Mobile app works without connectivity for 72+ hours
3. **Simple UI**: Designed for field workers with basic technical skills
4. **GPS Integration**: Turn-by-turn navigation to gate locations
5. **Photo Verification**: Captures gate positions with GPS metadata

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining mobile app screens
2. Implement background sync service
3. Add push notifications
4. Integrate with SMS gateway
5. Add Thai language support
6. Optimize battery usage
7. Add team communication features

The service is ready for integration with Instances 16 and 18, providing the critical scheduling and field coordination layer.
