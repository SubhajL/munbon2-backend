# Flow Monitoring Service Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Water Gate Controller with travel time calculations into the Flow Monitoring Service for the Munbon irrigation backend project.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Network Structure Visualization
- **Created multiple visualizations** of the Munbon irrigation network:
  - Text-based tree structure (`network_graph_text.py`)
  - HTML interactive graph (`munbon_network_graph.html`)
  - Python matplotlib visualization (`visualize_network_graph.py`)
- **Updated network structure** based on SCADA 2025-07-13 V0.95:
  - Correctly mapped M(0,0) → M(0,1) (RMC branch) and M(0,0) → M(0,2) (LMC start)
  - 59 gates across 6 zones with hierarchical naming structure
  - Saved as `munbon_network_updated.json`

### 2. Enhanced Water Gate Controller
- **Created `water_gate_controller_integrated.py`** with:
  - Travel time calculations using Manning's equation
  - Network path finding (BFS algorithm)
  - Flow propagation with delays
  - Water balance calculations
  - Gate operation optimization
  - Support for canal geometry data

### 3. Canal Geometry Template
- **Created `canal_geometry_template.json`**:
  - Template structure for canal sections
  - Required fields: length, cross-section, hydraulic parameters
  - Supports trapezoidal, rectangular, circular sections
  - Includes Manning's roughness coefficient and bed slope

### 4. Flow Monitoring Integration
- **Created `flow_monitoring_integration.py`** demonstrating:
  - Sensor data ingestion
  - Flow predictions with travel time
  - Downstream impact analysis
  - Zone-based water distribution optimization
  - Anomaly detection (flow restrictions, water losses)
  - Daily operational reporting

## Key Features Implemented

### Travel Time Calculations
```python
def calculate_travel_time(self, from_node: str, to_node: str, flow_rate: float) -> float:
    """Calculate water travel time between nodes using Manning's equation"""
    # V = (1/n) * R^(2/3) * S^(1/2)
    # Time = Distance / Velocity
```

### Flow Propagation
- Calculates when flow changes will reach each downstream gate
- Creates timeline of arrival events
- Accounts for canal geometry and hydraulic properties

### Water Balance
- Tracks inflow/outflow by zone
- Calculates system efficiency
- Detects excessive losses (>15% threshold)

### Optimization
- Recommends gate openings to meet zone demands
- Considers travel time from source
- Provides start time recommendations

## Network Statistics
- **Total Gates**: 59
- **Total Connections**: 59
- **Zones**: 6 (Zone 1-6)
- **Main Canals**: LMC, RMC, 9R-LMC, 38R-LMC, and sub-branches

## Example Flow Propagation Results
From the demo run:
- Opening M(0,0) to 90% generates 10.08 m³/s flow
- Zone 1 impacts: Immediate (0 minutes)
- Zone 6 (RMC) impacts: 14.5 minutes
- Zone 3 (9R-LMC) impacts: 71.7 minutes  
- Zone 2 (mid-LMC) impacts: 234.4 minutes
- Zone 4-5 (38R-LMC) impacts: 2000+ minutes (33+ hours)

## Next Steps
1. **Await actual canal geometry data** from user in JSON format
2. **Integrate with real sensor data** via MQTT/Kafka
3. **Implement hydraulic models** (Saint-Venant equations)
4. **Add machine learning** for predictive analytics
5. **Connect to SCADA system** via OPC UA
