# Moisture Data Gap Analysis: Aug 4-5, 2025

## Executive Summary
There was a **26-hour gap** in moisture data collection from **Aug 4 04:46 UTC to Aug 5 07:26 UTC**.

## Timeline of Events

### Data Collection Status
- **Last data before gap**: Aug 4 04:46:44 UTC
- **Data resumed**: Aug 5 07:26:02 UTC
- **Total gap duration**: ~26.5 hours

### Data Statistics
- **Aug 4 04:00-04:46 UTC**: 27 readings from 6 sensors
- **Aug 4 04:46 - Aug 5 07:26 UTC**: 0 readings (GAP)
- **Aug 5 07:00-08:00 UTC**: 2 readings from 1 sensor

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **EC2 HTTP Endpoint** ✅ Working
- Endpoint: `http://43.209.22.250:8080/api/sensor-data/moisture/munbon-m2m-moisture`
- Status: Online throughout the period
- Uptime: 3+ days
- Successfully forwarded data to SQS when received

### 2. **SQS Pipeline** ✅ Working
- Messages were successfully sent to SQS at 04:46 UTC
- No SQS errors during the gap period
- Queue is currently empty (no backlog)

### 3. **Consumer Process** ⚠️ Issues
- Local consumer restarted 6 times in 47 minutes
- No consumer running on EC2

### 4. **Database Storage** ✅ Working
- TimescaleDB successfully stored data when received
- Tables exist and are functional

## Conclusion
**The sensors themselves stopped sending data** during this period. The infrastructure (EC2 endpoint, SQS, database) remained operational but had no data to process.

## Sensor Activity Summary
```
Sensor ID | Last Seen Before Gap | First Seen After Gap
----------|---------------------|--------------------
0001-6    | Aug 4 04:46:41     | Not resumed
0001-4    | Aug 4 04:43:52     | Not resumed  
0001-8    | Aug 4 04:42:18     | Not resumed
0001-7    | Aug 4 04:40:36     | Not resumed
0001-1    | Aug 4 04:37:01     | Not resumed
0001-2    | Aug 4 04:36:48     | Not resumed

```

## Recommendations
1. **Check physical sensors** - They may have lost power or connectivity
2. **Monitor gateway devices** - Gateway IDs 0001, 0002, 0003 were active before the gap
3. **Set up alerts** - Alert when no data received for >1 hour
4. **Verify sensor configurations** - Ensure sensors are configured to send data continuously

## Current Status
- EC2 endpoint: ✅ Receiving data (as of Aug 5 07:57 UTC)
- Database: ✅ Storing new data
- Only 1-2 sensors currently active (compared to 6 before the gap)
