# EC2 Hypertable Conversion Summary

## Date: August 10, 2025

### Problem
- EC2 database tables (water_level_readings, moisture_readings) were regular PostgreSQL tables
- Dual-write was failing with error: "Make sure the TimescaleDB extension has been preloaded"
- Error code: 0A000 - attempting to insert into tables with hypertable triggers but not actual hypertables

### Solution Implemented
1. **Converted EC2 tables to TimescaleDB hypertables**
   - Dropped existing ts_insert_blocker triggers
   - Created hypertables with data migration:
     - water_level_readings → hypertable (6,406 rows migrated)
     - moisture_readings → hypertable (823 rows migrated)
   
2. **Verified hypertable creation**
   ```sql
   -- EC2 now has 5 hypertables:
   - awd_sensor_readings
   - irrigation_events  
   - moisture_readings (NEW)
   - sensor_readings
   - water_level_readings (NEW)
   ```

### Results
- **Dual-write is now WORKING**
- Latest moisture data (sensor 0001-8 at 2025-08-10 14:15:29) successfully written to BOTH:
  - Local TimescaleDB 
  - EC2 TimescaleDB
- Water level dual-write ready (no new data during test period)

### Current Status
- ✅ EC2 tables converted to hypertables
- ✅ Dual-write enabled and functioning
- ✅ Moisture data syncing to both databases
- ✅ Ready for water level data when sensors report

### Technical Details
- EC2 Host: 43.209.22.250
- Database: sensor_data
- TimescaleDB version: 2.21.0
- Foreign key constraints dropped (required for hypertable conversion)
- No unique constraints on (time, sensor_id) - using INSERT without ON CONFLICT
