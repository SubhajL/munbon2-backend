# Dual-Write Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Dual-Write Implementation
- Created `DualWriteRepository` wrapper class that manages writes to both local and EC2 databases
- Implemented automatic sensor registration for EC2 to handle foreign key constraints
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for EC2 writes
- Implemented timeout protection (5 seconds) for EC2 writes
- Added feature flags to enable/disable dual-write

### 2. Configuration
- Updated `.env.local` with dual-write configuration:
  ```env
  ENABLE_DUAL_WRITE=true
  EC2_DB_HOST=43.209.22.250
  EC2_DB_PORT=5432
  EC2_DB_NAME=sensor_data
  EC2_DB_USER=postgres
  EC2_DB_PASSWORD=P@ssw0rd123!
  ```

### 3. EC2 Database Fixes
- Fixed hypertable configuration issues (removed insert blocker triggers)
- Handled foreign key constraints by auto-registering sensors before data insertion
- Verified TimescaleDB is properly installed and configured

### 4. Monitoring Tools Created
- `scripts/test-dual-write.ts` - Compare data between local and EC2
- `scripts/monitor-dual-write.ts` - Real-time monitoring dashboard
- `scripts/check-ec2-hypertables.ts` - Check EC2 hypertable status
- `scripts/verify-table-structures.ts` - Verify schema compatibility

## üìä Current Status

- **Dual-Write**: ‚úÖ ENABLED and WORKING
- **Local Database**: Receiving all data successfully
- **EC2 Database**: Receiving new data successfully
- **Data Sync**: New data is being written to both databases

## üöÄ How to Use

### Start Consumer with Dual-Write
```bash
./start-consumer-dual-write.sh
```

### Monitor Dual-Write Status
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/monitor-dual-write.ts
```

### Kill Consumer
```bash
./kill-consumer.sh
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Historical Data Migration**: EC2 is only receiving new data. Consider migrating historical data if needed.

2. **Service Migration**: 
   - Port water level service to EC2
   - Port moisture service to EC2
   - Evaluate direct HTTP writes vs SQS for moisture data

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for EC2 write failures
   - Create dashboard for dual-write metrics
   - Monitor EC2 database performance

## üîß Troubleshooting

### EC2 Write Failures
- Check EC2 database connectivity
- Verify credentials in `.env.local`
- Check if sensor is registered in EC2's sensor_registry table

### TypeScript Errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that all imports are correct in `dual-write.repository.ts`

### Port Conflicts
- Use `./kill-consumer.sh` to stop all consumer processes
- Check PM2: `pm2 list` and `pm2 delete sensor-consumer` if needed
