# Realistic Service Allocation for t3.large (8GB RAM)

## Safe Memory Allocation Rule
- **Never use more than 80% of RAM**
- Available: 8GB × 0.8 = **6.4GB usable**
- Reserve 1.6GB for OS, buffers, spikes

## Reality Check: What Actually Fits

### Option 1: Run Core Services Only (Recommended)
```
System/OS:        1.5GB
K3s/Docker:       0.5GB
PostgreSQL:       1GB
Redis:            0.5GB
-----------------------
Core Services (6): 
- auth:           512MB
- sensor-data:    512MB
- gis:            512MB  
- flow-monitoring: 768MB
- scheduler:      512MB
- api-gateway:    512MB
-----------------------
Total:            6.8GB (comfortable)
```

### Option 2: All Services with Tiny Resources (Risky)
```
System/OS:        1.5GB
K3s:              0.5GB
PostgreSQL:       0.5GB (minimal)
15 services:      15 × 300MB = 4.5GB
-----------------------
Total:            7GB (very tight!)
```

**Problems:**
- Services will crash under load
- No room for traffic spikes
- Database will be slow
- One memory leak = everything dies

### Option 3: Smart Scheduling (Best Approach)

**Always Running (5GB):**
- Core services: auth, sensor-data, gis
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cache: Redis

**Scheduled/On-Demand (share 3GB):**
- weather-monitoring: Run every hour for 5 min
- water-accounting: Run at midnight
- reports: Run on-demand
- analytics: Run during off-hours

### Option 4: Use Spot Instances for Batch Jobs
```
Main EC2 (t3.large):     Core services
Spot Instance (t3.medium): Batch processing
                          - Costs $0.02/hour
                          - Run only when needed
```

## Realistic Deployment Commands

### For Docker Swarm with Limits:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  sensor-data:
    image: subhaj888/munbon-sensor-data
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          memory: 256M
      restart_policy:
        condition: any
        max_attempts: 3

  # Only deploy core services
  # Skip batch/scheduled services
```

### For K3s with Auto-scaling:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: service-quota
spec:
  hard:
    requests.memory: "6Gi"
    limits.memory: "7Gi"
---
# Use CronJobs for scheduled services
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: weather-update
spec:
  schedule: "0 * * * *"  # Every hour
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: weather
            image: munbon/weather-monitoring
            resources:
              limits:
                memory: "512Mi"
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## My Honest Recommendation

### Don't run all 15 services constantly on t3.large!

**Instead:**

1. **Identify Critical Services** (probably 5-7)
   - What needs 24/7 uptime?
   - What can run on schedule?
   - What's rarely used?

2. **Use This Architecture:**
   ```
   Always On (t3.large):
   - API Gateway
   - Auth Service  
   - Sensor Data Collection
   - PostgreSQL
   - Redis
   - 2-3 other critical services

   Serverless/Lambda:
   - Weather updates (cron)
   - Reports (on-demand)
   - Analytics (scheduled)
   
   Development Only:
   - Testing services
   - Admin panels
   ```

3. **Monitoring is Critical:**
   ```bash
   # Install monitoring first!
   helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
   helm install grafana grafana/grafana
   
   # Watch memory usage
   kubectl top nodes
   kubectl top pods
   ```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Q: Do all 15 services need to run 24/7?
├─ Yes → You need t3.xlarge (16GB) or multiple instances
└─ No → Continue
   │
   Q: Can you use serverless for some services?
   ├─ Yes → t3.large works! Use Lambda/Fargate for batch
   └─ No → Continue
      │
      Q: Can services share resources (not all active)?
      ├─ Yes → t3.large with K3s + careful scheduling
      └─ No → You need bigger infrastructure
```

## The Truth

With 8GB RAM, you can realistically run:
- 6-8 services comfortably
- 10-12 services with tight limits
- 15 services only if many are idle/scheduled

**What's your actual requirement?**
- Which services must run 24/7?
- Which can run on schedule?
- What's your traffic pattern?
