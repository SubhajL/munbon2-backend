# K3s for 15 Services - Real Analysis

## Current Setup vs Requirements

### Your 15 Services (from /services directory)
1. sensor-data
2. auth  
3. gis
4. flow-monitoring
5. weather-monitoring
6. water-level-monitoring
7. moisture-monitoring
8. rid-ms
9. ros
10. gravity-optimizer
11. water-accounting
12. sensor-network-management
13. scheduler
14. ros-gis-integration
15. awd-control

### Plus Supporting Services
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- MongoDB (if needed)
- Nginx/Traefik (ingress)

## Resource Requirements

### Minimum per Service
- CPU: 0.1-0.5 vCPU
- Memory: 256-512MB
- Total for 15 services: ~4-8 vCPU, 8-16GB RAM

### Current t2.micro EC2
- CPU: 1 vCPU
- Memory: 1GB RAM
- **VERDICT: Absolutely NOT enough!**

## Real Options for 15 Services

### Option 1: Larger EC2 with K3s
```
Instance Type: t3.xlarge
vCPU: 4
Memory: 16GB
Cost: ~$120/month

Or

Instance Type: t3.large  
vCPU: 2
Memory: 8GB
Cost: ~$60/month (minimum viable)
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# Still just 30 seconds!
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

# But need resource limits per service:
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "100m"
```

### Option 2: K3s Cluster (Multiple EC2s)
```
3 × t3.medium instances
- Master: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM
- Worker1: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM  
- Worker2: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM
Total: 6 vCPU, 12GB RAM
Cost: ~$90/month
```

**Better availability but more complex**

### Option 3: Smart Service Grouping

**Critical Services (Always On) - t3.medium**
- auth
- sensor-data
- gis
- flow-monitoring
- PostgreSQL
Cost: $30/month

**On-Demand Services (Scale to Zero) - t3.small**
- weather-monitoring (run every hour)
- scheduler (run on schedule)
- water-accounting (run daily)
- reports/analytics (run on demand)
Cost: ~$15/month

**Use K3s + Knative for scale-to-zero**

### Option 4: Development vs Production Split

**Development (K3s on t3.medium)**
- All 15 services with minimal resources
- 0.1 CPU, 256MB each
- Cost: $30/month

**Production (ECS Fargate)**
- Only active services
- Auto-scaling
- Proper resources
- Cost: $100-150/month

## Realistic K3s Deployment for 15 Services

### Minimum Viable Setup
```yaml
# Instance: t3.large (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) - $60/month

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sensor-data
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sensor-data
        image: subhaj888/munbon-sensor-data:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "100m"  # 0.1 CPU
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "200m"  # 0.2 CPU
```

### With Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: sensor-data-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: sensor-data
  minReplicas: 0  # Scale to zero!
  maxReplicas: 3
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

## Cost Comparison for 15 Services

| Option | Monthly Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| Single t2.micro | $10 | Cheap | Won't work! |
| t3.large + K3s | $60 | Simple, works | Single point of failure |
| 3 × t3.medium cluster | $90 | HA, scalable | Complex setup |
| Smart grouping | $45 | Cost effective | Requires planning |
| ECS Fargate | $150+ | Fully managed | More expensive |

## My Recommendation

### For Munbon with 15 Services:

**Phase 1: t3.large with K3s ($60/month)**
- Get everything running
- Learn Kubernetes
- Monitor actual resource usage

**Phase 2: Optimize with Knative**
- Add scale-to-zero for batch services
- Reduce costs by 30-40%

**Phase 3: Production Setup**
- Either: 3-node K3s cluster
- Or: Migrate critical services to ECS

### Installation Commands for t3.large
```bash
# 1. Upgrade your EC2 to t3.large first!

# 2. Install K3s
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

# 3. Install Helm (package manager)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash

# 4. Deploy all services with resource limits
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployments/

# 5. Install metrics server
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

# 6. Watch resources
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods
```

## Alternative: Use Docker Swarm First

If $60/month is too much, try Docker Swarm on t3.medium ($30/month):

```bash
docker swarm init
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml munbon

# Limit resources per service
services:
  sensor-data:
    image: subhaj888/munbon-sensor-data
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.20'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.10'
          memory: 256M
```

This might barely work with careful tuning!
