# Docker Services Status Report

## Summary
We successfully attempted to start all backend services using Docker containers connected to the EC2 database at 43.209.22.250:5432.

## Current Status

### Working Components
1. **EC2 Database**: ✅ Connected successfully (PostgreSQL 16.9 with TimescaleDB)
2. **Redis**: ✅ Running in Docker container (port 6379)
3. **Docker Engine**: ✅ Running via Colima

### Service Deployment Attempts

#### Method 1: Docker Compose Build
- **Status**: ❌ Failed
- **Issue**: DNS resolution errors during Alpine package installation
- **Error**: Unable to fetch packages (cairo, giflib, jpeg, pango)

#### Method 2: Pre-built Base Images
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partial Success
- **Running Containers**: 3 (redis, sensor-data, ros)
- **Failed Containers**: 3 (auth, gis, flow-monitoring)

### Service Issues

#### Node.js Services
1. **sensor-data** (3003): Container running but app crashed
   - Error: Database trigger creation failed
   - Code: 42710 (trigger already exists)

2. **ros** (3047): Container running but app crashed
   - Error: Missing dependency 'express-validator'
   - MODULE_NOT_FOUND error

3. **auth** (3001): Container exited
   - npm error: Cannot read properties of undefined

4. **gis** (3007): Container exited
   - npm error: Cannot read properties of undefined

#### Python Services
1. **flow-monitoring** (3011): Container exited
   - Error: Failed to build numpy wheel
   - Missing build dependencies for Alpine

## Root Causes

1. **Package Manager Issues**: npm failing with undefined property errors in Docker
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Services have dependencies not listed in package.json
3. **Database Schema Issues**: Triggers already exist in EC2 database
4. **Alpine Build Dependencies**: Python packages need additional system libraries

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix package.json files to include all dependencies
2. Add proper error handling for existing database objects
3. Use full Python images instead of Alpine for complex dependencies

### Alternative Approaches
1. Use PM2 directly on host machine (script created: `start-all-services-ec2-pm2.sh`)
2. Use docker-compose with custom Dockerfiles that handle dependencies
3. Use Kubernetes with proper health checks and restart policies

## Services Successfully Configured for EC2

All 17 services have been configured with proper EC2 database connections:
- Host: 43.209.22.250
- Port: 5432 (consolidated PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB)
- Password: P@ssw0rd123!
- Schemas: auth, gis, ros, awd, sensor_data, etc.

## Next Steps

1. Fix dependency issues in individual services
2. Create proper Dockerfiles with all required dependencies
3. Consider using docker-compose.override.yml for development
4. Implement proper health checks and readiness probes
