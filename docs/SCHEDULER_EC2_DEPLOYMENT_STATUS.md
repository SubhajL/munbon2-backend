# Scheduler Service EC2 Deployment Status

## Current Setup Clarification

### Local Development Setup (Currently Running)
- **PostgreSQL**: Port 5434 (local PostGIS container)
- **Redis**: Port 6379 (local Docker container)
- **Scheduler Service**: Port 3021 (local Python process)
- **Mock Server**: Port 3099 (local Python process)

### EC2 Production Setup (To Be Deployed)
- **PostgreSQL**: Port 5432 on EC2 (43.209.22.250)
- **Redis**: Would need to be deployed on EC2
- **Scheduler Service**: Would run on port 3021 on EC2
- **Mock Server**: Not needed in production

## Important Notes

1. **Database Schema**: 
   - Currently created in LOCAL PostgreSQL (port 5434)
   - Needs to be migrated to EC2 PostgreSQL (port 5432)
   - EC2 database credentials need verification

2. **Redis**:
   - Currently running locally
   - Not yet deployed on EC2
   - Would need to be added to EC2 docker-compose

3. **Service Dependencies**:
   - Python 3.13 compatibility issues with optimization libraries
   - Minimal version works without heavy dependencies
   - Full version requires Python 3.11 or 3.12

## Next Steps for EC2 Deployment

1. **Verify EC2 PostgreSQL Access**:
   ```bash
   # Test connection to EC2 PostgreSQL
   PGPASSWORD='correct_password' psql -h 43.209.22.250 -p 5432 -U postgres -d munbon_dev
   ```

2. **Deploy Redis on EC2**:
   - Add Redis to EC2 docker-compose
   - Configure persistence and security

3. **Deploy Scheduler Service**:
   - Build Docker image with Python 3.11/3.12
   - Add to EC2 docker-compose
   - Configure environment variables

4. **Update Service URLs**:
   - Point to actual services instead of mock server
   - Update Flow Monitoring URL (port 3011)
   - Update ROS/GIS URL (port 3041)

## Current Status Summary

✅ **Local Development Environment**: Fully functional
- All services running locally
- Database schema created
- Basic API endpoints working

❌ **EC2 Production Environment**: Not yet deployed
- Needs database migration
- Needs Redis deployment
- Needs service containerization

The scheduler service is ready for local development and testing. EC2 deployment requires additional steps including verifying database credentials and containerizing the service.
