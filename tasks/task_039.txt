# Task ID: 39
# Title: Create Shared Libraries Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the shared libraries directory with common code that will be used across multiple microservices, including TypeScript interfaces, middleware, utilities, database schemas, protocol buffer definitions, and common configuration patterns.
# Details:
1. Create the following subdirectories within the `/shared` directory:
   - `/shared/interfaces` - For TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
   - `/shared/middleware` - For common Express/HTTP middleware components
   - `/shared/utils` - For utility functions and helper classes
   - `/shared/database` - For database schemas, models, and connection utilities
   - `/shared/proto` - For protocol buffer definitions
   - `/shared/config` - For common configuration patterns and constants

2. Set up TypeScript configuration for the shared libraries:
   - Create a base `tsconfig.json` in the shared directory
   - Configure module resolution, declaration file generation, and export options
   - Set up path aliases for easy importing

3. Implement package management for shared libraries:
   - Create a package.json for each subdirectory or a workspace-based approach
   - Configure dependencies with appropriate versioning
   - Set up build scripts and export configurations

4. Create documentation for shared library usage:
   - Add README.md files in each subdirectory explaining purpose and usage
   - Include examples of how to import and use shared components
   - Document versioning and dependency management approach

5. Implement initial common utilities:
   - Error handling classes and utilities
   - Logging framework integration
   - Date/time utilities
   - Input validation helpers
   - Authentication/authorization utilities

6. Set up testing framework for shared libraries:
   - Configure Jest or similar testing framework
   - Create example tests for shared components
   - Set up CI integration for shared library testing

7. Implement versioning strategy:
   - Define semantic versioning approach for shared libraries
   - Document breaking vs. non-breaking changes policy
   - Set up change tracking mechanism

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify directory structure:
   - Confirm all required subdirectories exist with correct naming
   - Validate that README.md files are present in each subdirectory
   - Check that TypeScript configuration is properly set up

2. Test package management:
   - Verify package.json files are correctly configured
   - Test that dependencies can be installed without conflicts
   - Validate that build scripts work correctly

3. Test library imports:
   - Create a simple test microservice that imports from each shared library
   - Verify that TypeScript types and interfaces are correctly exported and imported
   - Test that utility functions can be called from external services

4. Unit test shared components:
   - Run the test suite for shared libraries
   - Verify that all initial utilities have test coverage
   - Validate error handling and edge cases

5. Integration testing:
   - Test the integration between multiple shared libraries
   - Verify that middleware components work correctly when imported
   - Test database utilities with a test database instance

6. Documentation review:
   - Verify that documentation is clear and comprehensive
   - Ensure examples are accurate and functional
   - Check that versioning strategy is clearly documented

7. Code quality checks:
   - Run linting on shared library code
   - Verify code style consistency
   - Check for any security vulnerabilities in utilities
