# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement ROS (Remote Operation System) Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 10, 15, 40
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Reservoir Operation Study microservice for computing water demand for the Munbon area, including crop water requirements, irrigation efficiency, and seasonal demand patterns.
# Details:
Build ROS Service using Node.js/TypeScript to process comprehensive Excel files containing water demand data. Implement functionality to calculate crop water requirements based on input parameters. Create modules to analyze irrigation efficiency across different zones. Develop algorithms to identify seasonal demand patterns. Implement data validation for Excel file inputs. Create a processing pipeline for large datasets. Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed calculations. Implement exportable reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel). Create visualization components for demand patterns. Store calculation history with version tracking. Integrate with notification service for processing completion alerts. Implement parallel processing for handling multiple calculation requests.

# Test Strategy:
Test Excel file parsing accuracy. Verify crop water requirement calculations against known examples. Test irrigation efficiency analysis with sample datasets. Validate seasonal pattern detection algorithms. Test data validation error handling. Verify processing pipeline for large files. Test caching mechanisms for performance improvements. Validate report generation in all formats. Test visualization accuracy. Verify calculation history and version tracking. Test parallel processing capabilities with multiple simultaneous requests.
