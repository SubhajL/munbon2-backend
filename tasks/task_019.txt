# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the File Processing Service for handling large file uploads, raster data processing, and file storage management.
# Details:
Implement file processing service using Spring Boot or NestJS. Set up MinIO (latest version) or S3-compatible storage for file storage. Integrate with GDAL (v3.6+) for raster data processing. Implement chunked upload for large files using tus protocol. Develop background job processing using Bull or Spring Batch. Create import/export operations for various file formats. Implement file transformation pipelines. Set up virus scanning for uploaded files using ClamAV. Configure proper access control for files. Consider using managed object storage if available in Thailand region.

# Test Strategy:
Test large file upload functionality. Validate raster data processing with sample imagery. Test background job processing. Verify import/export operations with different file formats. Test file transformation pipelines. Benchmark file processing performance under load. Validate security of file storage and access.
