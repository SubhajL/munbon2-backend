# Task ID: 53
# Title: Create Comprehensive API Contract Definition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Define all API specifications, OpenAPI/Swagger definitions, request/response schemas, versioning strategy, and authentication patterns for all microservices to serve as the contract that all services must follow.
# Details:
1. **API Specification Framework**:
   - Adopt OpenAPI 3.1 as the standard specification format for all microservices
   - Create a centralized repository for all API definitions with proper version control
   - Define standardized naming conventions for endpoints following RESTful principles

2. **Core API Components**:
   - Define base URL patterns and resource naming conventions
   - Establish standard HTTP methods usage (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
   - Create consistent error response formats with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Define pagination, filtering, and sorting patterns for collection endpoints

3. **Request/Response Schemas**:
   - Create JSON Schema definitions for all request and response objects
   - Define required vs. optional fields with appropriate data types and constraints
   - Implement consistent date/time formats (ISO 8601) and numeric precision standards
   - Establish field naming conventions (camelCase vs. snake_case)

4. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Define OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect flows for different client types
   - Specify JWT structure, claims, and signature requirements
   - Document API key usage for service-to-service communication
   - Define role-based access control (RBAC) patterns for endpoints

5. **Versioning Strategy**:
   - Implement semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for all APIs
   - Define URL-based versioning strategy (e.g., /v1/resources)
   - Document backward compatibility requirements and deprecation policies
   - Create migration guides for version transitions

6. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
   - Define rate limiting and throttling specifications
   - Document CORS policies for web clients
   - Specify caching strategies and cache control headers
   - Establish logging requirements for API requests/responses

7. **Documentation**:
   - Generate interactive API documentation using Swagger UI or ReDoc
   - Create usage examples for common scenarios
   - Document integration patterns between microservices
   - Provide SDK generation guidelines for client applications

# Test Strategy:
1. **Documentation Review**:
   - Conduct peer reviews of API specifications with architects and lead developers
   - Verify all endpoints follow the established naming conventions and patterns
   - Ensure all request/response schemas are properly defined with examples
   - Validate that authentication and authorization patterns are consistently applied

2. **Specification Validation**:
   - Use OpenAPI linting tools (Spectral) to validate all API definitions
   - Check for common API design issues using automated tools
   - Verify semantic versioning is correctly implemented across all services
   - Ensure all required fields are properly documented

3. **Mock Server Testing**:
   - Generate mock servers from OpenAPI definitions using tools like Prism
   - Test API contracts against mock servers to validate request/response patterns
   - Verify error handling behaves according to specifications
   - Test pagination, filtering, and sorting implementations

4. **Security Review**:
   - Conduct security review of authentication and authorization patterns
   - Validate JWT structure and claims against security best practices
   - Test rate limiting and throttling specifications
   - Verify proper implementation of CORS policies

5. **Developer Experience Testing**:
   - Have developers from different teams review and provide feedback on usability
   - Test generated client SDKs against the API specifications
   - Verify documentation clarity and completeness
   - Ensure examples cover common use cases

6. **Integration Testing**:
   - Validate that existing services can be updated to conform to the new API contracts
   - Test cross-service communication patterns
   - Verify versioning strategy works with existing CI/CD pipelines
   - Ensure backward compatibility requirements are met
