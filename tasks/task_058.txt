# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a specialized Backend-for-Frontend service for comprehensive dashboards, providing aggregated data views, KPIs, and analytics for different user roles including farmers, operators, and administrators.
# Details:
Build Dashboard BFF using Node.js/TypeScript with Express.js or NestJS. Implement RESTful and GraphQL APIs optimized for dashboard data aggregation. Create role-specific dashboard endpoints (farmer dashboard, operator dashboard, admin dashboard). Implement real-time KPI calculations for water usage efficiency, system performance, and crop health metrics. Add time-series data aggregation for historical trending with configurable time windows. Create geospatial data aggregation for map-based visualizations. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed metrics using Redis. Add support for custom dashboard configurations per user. Create alert summary endpoints with priority filtering. Implement comparative analytics APIs (year-over-year, zone comparisons). Add export capabilities for reports and data downloads. Create mobile-responsive data endpoints. Implement server-side data filtering and aggregation to minimize client processing.

# Test Strategy:
Test data aggregation from multiple microservices. Verify role-based dashboard access. Test real-time KPI calculation accuracy. Validate time-series aggregation with various time windows. Test geospatial data formatting for maps. Verify caching performance and invalidation. Test custom dashboard persistence. Validate alert aggregation and filtering. Test comparative analytics calculations. Verify export functionality for various formats. Load test with concurrent dashboard users.
