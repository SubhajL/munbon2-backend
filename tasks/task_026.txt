# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement User Management Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a dedicated microservice for user profile management, role management, permission management, and user preferences that handles all user-related operations separate from authentication.
# Details:
1. Create a new Spring Boot (v3.0+) or Node.js (v18+) microservice with a clean architecture pattern separating controllers, services, and repositories.

2. Design and implement the following data models:
   - UserProfile: containing personal information, contact details, and profile metadata
   - UserRole: defining role assignments and hierarchies
   - UserPermission: granular permission definitions
   - UserPreference: user-specific settings and preferences

3. Implement RESTful API endpoints for:
   - User profile CRUD operations
   - Role assignment and management
   - Permission management
   - User preference settings

4. Integrate with the Authentication & Authorization Service (Task 4) to:
   - Validate user tokens for authenticated requests
   - Retrieve basic user identity information
   - Synchronize role and permission data

5. Implement database layer using:
   - PostgreSQL (v15+) for relational data with proper indexing
   - Redis (v7.0+) for caching frequently accessed user data
   - Implement database migrations using Flyway or Liquibase

6. Implement event-driven communication:
   - Publish events for user profile changes, role changes, etc.
   - Subscribe to relevant auth service events (user creation, deletion)
   - Use Kafka (v3.0+) or RabbitMQ (v3.10+) for message brokering

7. Implement security measures:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Data encryption for sensitive fields
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

8. Add observability:
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Metrics collection for key operations
   - Distributed tracing integration
   - Health check endpoints

9. Containerize the service:
   - Create optimized Docker image
   - Configure Kubernetes deployment manifests
   - Set up appropriate resource limits and requests

10. Implement data validation:
    - Use Bean Validation (Java) or Joi/Yup (Node.js)
    - Implement custom validators for complex business rules
    - Add comprehensive error messages for validation failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all service and repository layers
   - Use JUnit/Mockito (Java) or Jest/Mocha (Node.js) with 80%+ code coverage
   - Mock external dependencies and database connections

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test database interactions with TestContainers
   - Verify event publishing and subscription
   - Test API endpoints with actual database connections
   - Validate proper error handling and edge cases

3. API Contract Testing:
   - Implement contract tests using Pact or Spring Cloud Contract
   - Ensure backward compatibility for API changes
   - Validate request/response schemas against OpenAPI specification

4. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load tests using JMeter or k6
   - Verify response times under various load conditions
   - Test caching effectiveness and database query performance
   - Identify and resolve bottlenecks

5. Security Testing:
   - Perform static code analysis with SonarQube
   - Run dependency vulnerability scans
   - Test for common security issues (OWASP Top 10)
   - Verify proper authentication and authorization

6. End-to-End Testing:
   - Test integration with Authentication Service
   - Verify complete user management workflows
   - Test role and permission propagation
   - Validate user preference persistence and retrieval

7. Manual Testing:
   - Verify UI integration with user management endpoints
   - Test user experience for profile management
   - Validate role and permission visibility in UI

8. Acceptance Criteria Validation:
   - Verify all user profile operations work correctly
   - Confirm role management functions as expected
   - Test permission assignment and enforcement
   - Validate user preference storage and application
