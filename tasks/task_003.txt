# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup API Gateway
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 53
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement an API Gateway to orchestrate all client requests and provide a unified entry point to the microservices.
# Details:
Deploy Kong API Gateway (v3.0+) or Traefik (v2.9+) as the API Gateway. Configure routes for all microservices. Implement rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks. Set up SSL termination with Let's Encrypt. Configure request/response transformation. Implement circuit breaking patterns for resilience. Set up logging and monitoring integration. Configure CORS policies. Implement API versioning strategy. Consider Kong's plugin ecosystem for additional functionality like JWT validation, request transformation, and logging. Ensure gateway can handle 10,000+ concurrent connections as per requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test route configurations with automated API tests. Verify rate limiting functionality. Test SSL certificate validation. Simulate circuit breaking scenarios. Validate CORS configurations. Perform load testing to ensure gateway can handle required throughput. Test API versioning.
