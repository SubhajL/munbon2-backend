# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Water Distribution Control Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Water Distribution Control Service with optimization engine, scheduling algorithms, and hydraulic network modeling.
# Details:
Implement multi-objective optimization engine using OR-Tools (v9.6+) or CPLEX. Develop gate and pump scheduling algorithms based on hydraulic models. Integrate with EPANET (v2.2+) for hydraulic network modeling. Implement demand prediction integration with AI Model Service. Create control command generation with safety constraints. Use Graph Neural Networks for network state representation (PyTorch Geometric or DGL). Implement constraint validation for physical limitations. Develop scenario planning capabilities. Consider implementing digital twin simulation for testing control strategies.

# Test Strategy:
Test optimization engine with benchmark problems. Validate scheduling algorithms with historical data. Test hydraulic model integration. Verify control command generation with safety constraints. Test demand prediction integration. Benchmark optimization performance. Validate constraint satisfaction under various scenarios.
