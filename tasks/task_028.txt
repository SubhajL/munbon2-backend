# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Crop Management Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a microservice for managing crop data, growth stages, planting schedules, harvest tracking, crop water requirements, and integration with AquaCrop model for crop yield predictions.
# Details:
1. Architecture and Setup:
   - Create a Spring Boot (v3.0+) or NestJS (v10+) microservice with a modular architecture
   - Implement domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
   - Set up Docker containerization with multi-stage builds for minimal image size
   - Configure Kubernetes deployment manifests with appropriate resource limits

2. Data Model Design:
   - Design PostgreSQL schemas for crop data with PostGIS integration for spatial data
   - Create MongoDB collections for crop documentation, growth stage images, and unstructured data
   - Implement entity relationships between crops, growth stages, planting schedules, and harvests
   - Design data models for water requirements and yield prediction parameters

3. Core Functionality:
   - Implement CRUD operations for crop management (varieties, characteristics, growing conditions)
   - Create APIs for managing growth stages with image storage capabilities
   - Develop planting schedule management with calendar integration
   - Build harvest tracking system with yield recording and analysis
   - Implement water requirement calculation based on crop type, growth stage, and environmental conditions

4. AquaCrop Integration:
   - Develop integration layer with AquaCrop model API for crop yield predictions
   - Implement data transformation between service models and AquaCrop input format
   - Create caching mechanism for prediction results to optimize performance
   - Build scheduled jobs for periodic yield predictions based on current conditions

5. API Development:
   - Design RESTful API endpoints following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
   - Implement GraphQL API for complex data queries
   - Create API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Register service endpoints with API Gateway for external access

6. Security Implementation:
   - Implement JWT authentication and role-based authorization
   - Set up data validation and sanitization for all inputs
   - Configure CORS policies for web client access
   - Implement audit logging for all data modifications

7. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests with JUnit/Jest (90%+ coverage)
   - Implement integration tests for database operations and external service calls
   - Create performance tests for high-load scenarios
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline integration with automated testing

8. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Implement health check endpoints
   - Configure metrics collection with Prometheus
   - Set up distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
   - Create custom dashboards for service monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for all service layers, controllers, and utility classes
   - Use Mockito/Jest to mock dependencies and external services
   - Test edge cases and error handling scenarios
   - Verify data validation logic and business rules

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up test containers for PostgreSQL and MongoDB to test database operations
   - Create integration tests for AquaCrop model API integration
   - Test API Gateway integration with mock services
   - Verify data persistence and retrieval across different storage systems

3. API Testing:
   - Use Postman/Newman or REST Assured to test all API endpoints
   - Create automated API test suite covering all endpoints and response codes
   - Test API authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Verify API rate limiting and throttling

4. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load testing with JMeter or k6 to verify service handles expected load
   - Test database query performance with large datasets
   - Measure response times for yield prediction calculations
   - Verify caching mechanisms work correctly under load

5. Functional Testing:
   - Create end-to-end tests for key user journeys
   - Test crop data management workflows from creation to harvest
   - Verify planting schedule functionality with different time zones
   - Test yield prediction accuracy against known outcomes

6. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on API endpoints
   - Verify proper authentication and authorization
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Verify data encryption for sensitive information

7. Acceptance Testing:
   - Demonstrate service functionality to stakeholders
   - Verify integration with front-end applications
   - Test compatibility with mobile and web clients
   - Validate that all business requirements are met

8. Deployment Verification:
   - Test service deployment in staging environment
   - Verify Kubernetes resource allocation and scaling
   - Test service discovery and API Gateway integration
   - Validate monitoring and alerting configuration
