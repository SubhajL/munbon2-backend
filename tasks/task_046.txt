# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement Water Level Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 7, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a specialized microservice for water level monitoring across canals, reservoirs, and distribution points with real-time data processing and level-based alerts.
# Details:
Create Water Level Service using Node.js/TypeScript for real-time processing. Implement data ingestion from ultrasonic, pressure, and radar level sensors. Apply sensor-specific calibration and noise filtering algorithms. Calculate water volume from level data using canal/reservoir geometry. Implement rate of change calculations for flood/drought warnings. Create multi-tier alerting system for critical level thresholds. Store time-series data in TimescaleDB with retention policies. Implement data aggregation for hourly, daily, and monthly statistics. Create APIs for level trends, historical comparisons, and forecasting. Integrate with GIS service for spatial level visualization. Implement sensor redundancy and voting algorithms for critical locations.

# Test Strategy:
Test sensor data ingestion from multiple sensor types. Verify calibration accuracy. Test volume calculations with known geometries. Validate alert triggering at various levels. Test rate of change calculations. Verify data aggregation accuracy. Test API performance under load. Validate sensor redundancy algorithms.
