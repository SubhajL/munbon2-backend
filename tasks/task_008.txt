# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Sensor Data Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Sensor Data Service for IoT sensor integration, data ingestion, and real-time streaming.
# Details:
Implement MQTT broker using Eclipse Mosquitto (v2.0+) or HiveMQ (v4.0+). Develop sensor data service using Spring Boot or NestJS with MQTT client libraries. Integrate with TimescaleDB for data storage. Implement data validation and quality checks using JSON Schema. Set up real-time data streaming with WebSockets or Server-Sent Events. Create historical data query APIs with filtering capabilities. Implement sensor calibration management. Use Kafka Streams or Spring Cloud Stream for data processing pipelines. Consider using InfluxDB as a complementary time-series database for specific workloads. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms for sensor data ingestion.

# Test Strategy:
Test MQTT broker with simulated sensor data. Validate data ingestion pipelines. Test data validation rules. Benchmark time-series data insertion performance. Test real-time streaming functionality. Validate historical data queries. Test sensor calibration workflows. Perform load testing with simulated sensor networks.
