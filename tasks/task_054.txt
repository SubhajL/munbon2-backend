# Task ID: 54
# Title: Import AOS Meteorological Data from MS SQL to TimescaleDB
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an ETL process to extract weather data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind, pressure) from the AOS (Automatic Operation System) MS SQL Server database, transform it to match our time-series schema, and load it into TimescaleDB with proper timestamps and sensor metadata.
# Details:
1. Data Source Analysis:
   - Connect to the MS SQL Server database containing AOS meteorological data
   - Document the schema structure, data types, and relationships
   - Identify primary and foreign keys, indexes, and constraints
   - Analyze data quality, completeness, and potential issues
   - Document the frequency of data updates and volume expectations

2. Data Mapping and Transformation Design:
   - Create a detailed mapping document between source (MS SQL) and target (TimescaleDB) schemas
   - Design transformation rules for each weather parameter (rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind, pressure)
   - Define standardization procedures for units, timestamps, and coordinate systems
   - Establish sensor metadata structure and relationships
   - Design data validation and cleansing rules

3. ETL Pipeline Implementation:
   - Utilize the Data Integration Service for implementing the ETL pipeline
   - Implement MS SQL Server connector using JDBC or equivalent
   - Develop data extraction queries with proper filtering and pagination
   - Implement transformation logic according to the mapping document
   - Create TimescaleDB hypertable loader with proper chunking and batching
   - Implement error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms
   - Add data validation checks at each stage of the pipeline

4. Scheduling and Orchestration:
   - Configure incremental data extraction based on timestamps or change tracking
   - Implement scheduling for regular data imports (hourly/daily)
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures
   - Implement data reconciliation processes to ensure completeness
   - Configure resource allocation for optimal performance

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement batch processing for efficient data loading
   - Configure connection pooling for database connections
   - Optimize query performance for both extraction and loading
   - Implement parallel processing where applicable
   - Configure appropriate TimescaleDB chunk sizes based on data volume

6. Documentation and Deployment:
   - Document the entire ETL process, including data lineage
   - Create operational runbooks for maintenance and troubleshooting
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for deployment
   - Provide usage examples and API documentation
   - Create monitoring dashboards for data flow visualization

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test individual components of the ETL pipeline in isolation
   - Validate transformation logic with known input/output pairs
   - Test error handling and edge cases (null values, extreme values, etc.)
   - Verify data type conversions and format standardizations
   - Test connection handling and retry mechanisms

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete ETL pipeline with a subset of real data
   - Verify correct data flow between all components
   - Test incremental data loading scenarios
   - Validate error propagation and logging
   - Test scheduling and orchestration functionality

3. Data Validation Testing:
   - Compare record counts between source and destination
   - Verify data integrity through checksum or sampling comparisons
   - Validate timestamp consistency and timezone handling
   - Test sensor metadata correctness and relationships
   - Verify unit conversions and standardizations

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure throughput with various batch sizes
   - Test with production-like data volumes
   - Identify and resolve bottlenecks
   - Verify resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
   - Test concurrent operations and potential locking issues

5. Acceptance Testing:
   - Verify end-to-end functionality with stakeholders
   - Validate data visualization and querying capabilities
   - Test data availability for downstream applications
   - Verify compliance with data retention policies
   - Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

6. Regression Testing:
   - Create automated test suite for continuous validation
   - Implement data quality checks as part of CI/CD pipeline
   - Test backward compatibility with existing applications
   - Verify that changes don't affect other data pipelines
