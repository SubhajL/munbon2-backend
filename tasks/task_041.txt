# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement IoT Gateway Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an IoT Gateway service that acts as a bridge between field IoT devices (sensors, actuators) and the backend microservices, handling protocol translation, device management, and edge computing capabilities.
# Details:
Build IoT Gateway using Node.js with support for multiple IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP, LoRaWAN, Modbus). Implement device registration and authentication using X.509 certificates or pre-shared keys. Create protocol translation layer to convert various IoT protocols to unified internal format. Implement edge computing capabilities for data filtering, aggregation, and anomaly detection at the gateway level. Set up device twin/shadow for offline device state management. Implement firmware over-the-air (FOTA) update capabilities. Create device grouping and bulk operations support. Implement data compression and batching for bandwidth optimization. Add support for time-series data buffering during network outages. Integrate with AWS IoT Core or Azure IoT Hub for cloud connectivity. Implement device health monitoring and automatic reconnection strategies.

# Test Strategy:
Test multi-protocol support with simulated devices. Verify device authentication mechanisms. Test edge computing rules and data filtering. Simulate network outages and test data buffering. Test FOTA update process. Verify protocol translation accuracy. Load test with thousands of simulated devices. Test device grouping and bulk operations. Validate security with penetration testing.
