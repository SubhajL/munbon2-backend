# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Kubernetes Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure for the microservices architecture with necessary namespaces, RBAC, and network policies.
# Details:
Use Terraform (v1.5+) to provision a Kubernetes cluster (v1.26+) with appropriate node pools for different workloads. Configure namespaces for each microservice domain. Implement network policies for service isolation. Set up Helm (v3.12+) for package management. Configure persistent volumes for stateful services. Implement resource quotas and limits. Use kustomize for environment-specific configurations. Consider AKS, GKE, or EKS based on deployment region requirements in Thailand. Ensure compliance with Thai government security standards by implementing appropriate network segmentation.

# Test Strategy:
Validate cluster setup with kubectl commands. Test namespace isolation. Verify RBAC configurations with audit logs. Run security scanning with Trivy or Clair. Perform load testing to ensure the cluster can handle 10,000+ concurrent connections. Validate persistent volume claims.
