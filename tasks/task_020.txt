# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 8, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop GraphQL API endpoints for complex data queries and efficient data fetching.
# Details:
Implement GraphQL API using Apollo Server (v4.7+) or GraphQL Java (v20+). Develop GraphQL schema for all relevant domain entities. Implement resolvers for efficient data fetching. Set up DataLoader for batching and caching. Configure proper authentication and authorization for GraphQL endpoints. Implement subscription support for real-time updates. Create documentation using GraphQL introspection. Consider using GraphQL Code Generator for type-safe client code generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test GraphQL queries with sample data. Validate resolver functionality. Test DataLoader batching and caching. Verify subscription functionality for real-time updates. Benchmark query performance under load. Test authentication and authorization. Validate schema documentation.
