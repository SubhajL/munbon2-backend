# Task ID: 48
# Title: Implement RID-MS (Royal Irrigation Department - Management System) Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 18, 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a microservice for retrieving and processing SHAPE files from Royal Irrigation Department that describe water demand zones, irrigation boundaries, and agricultural areas within the Munbon project for spatial water demand analysis.
# Details:
Create RID-MS Service using Java/Spring Boot to retrieve and process SHAPE files from the Royal Irrigation Department. Implement functionality to fetch SHAPE files containing water demand zones, irrigation boundaries, and agricultural areas specific to the Munbon project. Develop data processing capabilities to extract spatial information and water demand metrics from these SHAPE files. Create a data model to store and represent the spatial water demand information. Implement APIs to query water demand data by geographic area, time period, and agricultural type. Develop visualization components to represent water demand zones on maps. Create scheduled jobs to regularly update SHAPE files from RID sources. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed spatial data. Ensure proper error handling for file format issues or connectivity problems with RID systems. Provide data export functionality in standard GIS formats.

# Test Strategy:
Test SHAPE file retrieval from RID sources using mock data. Verify correct parsing and processing of SHAPE files with known test data. Test spatial queries against processed data. Validate visualization of water demand zones. Test scheduled update functionality with simulated RID data sources. Verify error handling for malformed SHAPE files and connection issues. Test performance with large SHAPE files. Validate data export functionality to standard GIS formats. Ensure proper integration with other system components that consume spatial water demand data.
