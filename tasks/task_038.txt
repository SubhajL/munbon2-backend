# Task ID: 38
# Title: Generate Service Boilerplate Templates
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Create reusable boilerplate templates for each programming language (Node.js/TypeScript, Python/FastAPI, Go, Java/Spring Boot) that can be used to quickly scaffold new microservices with standard structure, configuration files, Docker setup, and basic health check endpoints.
# Details:
1. Create a `/templates` directory within the project structure to store all boilerplate templates.

2. For each programming language, develop a comprehensive template that includes:
   - Standard directory structure following best practices for that language
   - Configuration files (environment variables, logging, etc.)
   - Dockerfile optimized for that language with multi-stage builds
   - Docker Compose configuration for local development
   - Kubernetes deployment manifests (deployment, service, configmap)
   - Basic health check and readiness endpoints
   - Dependency management files (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, pom.xml)
   - README with usage instructions
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration

3. Node.js/TypeScript template specifics:
   - Use TypeScript with strict type checking
   - Include ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Set up Jest for testing
   - Implement Express.js with middleware structure
   - Include error handling middleware
   - Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

4. Python/FastAPI template specifics:
   - Use FastAPI framework with Pydantic models
   - Include pytest configuration
   - Set up virtual environment management
   - Implement dependency injection pattern
   - Add OpenAPI documentation

5. Go template specifics:
   - Follow standard Go project layout
   - Include Go modules configuration
   - Set up testing with testify
   - Implement graceful shutdown
   - Add middleware for logging, metrics

6. Java/Spring Boot template specifics:
   - Use Spring Boot with appropriate starters
   - Include Maven/Gradle build configuration
   - Set up JUnit and Mockito for testing
   - Implement controller/service/repository pattern
   - Add Actuator endpoints for monitoring

7. Create a template initialization script that can:
   - Copy the appropriate template to a new directory
   - Replace placeholder values with actual service name
   - Initialize git repository
   - Install dependencies

8. Document usage instructions for each template in a central README.md file.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual verification:
   - For each language template, create a new microservice by copying the template
   - Verify all files and directories are correctly structured
   - Build the Docker image and ensure it compiles without errors
   - Run the containerized service locally and verify health check endpoints

2. Automated testing:
   - Create a test script that initializes a new service from each template
   - Automatically build Docker images for each initialized service
   - Run containers and verify health check endpoints return 200 OK
   - Verify that all required files and configurations are present
   - Test the template initialization script with different service names

3. Integration testing:
   - Deploy a test service created from each template to the Kubernetes cluster
   - Verify the service can be accessed through Kubernetes service discovery
   - Test that health checks are properly recognized by Kubernetes
   - Verify that logging and monitoring are correctly configured

4. Documentation testing:
   - Review README files for completeness and accuracy
   - Ensure all configuration options are documented
   - Verify that usage instructions are clear and correct
   - Have another team member follow the instructions to create a new service

5. Cross-language consistency check:
   - Verify that all templates follow the same overall structure
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions across templates
   - Check that Docker and Kubernetes configurations are standardized
   - Confirm that health check endpoints behave consistently
