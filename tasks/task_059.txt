# Task ID: 59
# Title: Implement Dual-Mode Gate Control System (Automated + Manual)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 50
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a unified control system that seamlessly coordinates 20 automated gates with manual gate operations, supporting both real-time control and weekly batch scheduling.
# Details:
Create a dual-mode gate control system that operates in two synchronized modes: real-time automated control for the 20 motorized gates and coordinated manual batch operations for the remaining gates. Implement gate classification system (automated/manual/hybrid). Develop real-time control algorithms for automated gates with PID controllers for flow regulation. Create manual gate instruction generator that accounts for automated gate states. Implement synchronization protocol ensuring manual and automated operations don't conflict. Build fallback procedures when automated gates fail (convert to manual mode). Create unified gate state tracking across both systems. Implement predictive algorithms to pre-position automated gates before manual operations. Develop safety interlocks preventing conflicting operations. Create API endpoints for both SCADA (automated) and field team apps (manual).

# Test Strategy:
Test automated gate control with simulated SCADA signals. Verify manual instruction generation accuracy. Test synchronization between manual and automated operations. Simulate automated gate failures and verify fallback procedures. Test conflict detection and resolution. Verify state consistency across both modes. Test predictive pre-positioning algorithms. Validate safety interlocks under various scenarios.
