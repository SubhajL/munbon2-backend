# Task ID: 65
# Title: Build Real-time to Batch Mode Transition System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 59, 60
# Priority: high
# Description: Create intelligent system that seamlessly transitions between real-time automated control and batch manual operations based on conditions and constraints.
# Details:
Develop mode transition controller that automatically switches between real-time and batch operation modes based on automated gate availability, sensor coverage, and operational constraints. Implement state preservation ensuring smooth transitions without water loss or delivery interruption. Create mode selection algorithm considering weather forecasts, maintenance schedules, power availability, and staff resources. Build transition protocols for planned switches (maintenance) and unplanned events (power failure). Implement gradual transition capabilities allowing partial automation during manual batch periods. Create notification system alerting operators and field teams of mode changes. Develop performance comparison tracking efficiency in both modes. Build learning algorithms optimizing mode selection based on historical performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test mode transition under various triggers. Verify state preservation during transitions. Test mode selection algorithm logic. Validate planned transition protocols. Test emergency transition handling. Verify gradual transition functionality. Test notification delivery to all stakeholders. Validate performance tracking metrics. Test learning algorithm improvements.
