# Task ID: 5
# Title: Setup PostgreSQL with PostGIS
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and configure PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial data operations and management.
# Details:
Deploy PostgreSQL (v15+) with PostGIS extension (v3.3+) using the postgis/postgis:15-3.3 image. For local development, run in a Docker container via Docker Compose exposing port 5432. For production, deploy on Kubernetes using StatefulSets. Configure proper storage classes for persistence. Set up automated backups and point-in-time recovery. Implement connection pooling with PgBouncer. Configure replication for high availability. Set up proper indexing strategies for spatial data. Implement database migrations using Flyway or Liquibase. Configure PostGIS for Thai coordinate reference systems. Optimize PostgreSQL for spatial queries with appropriate configuration parameters. Consider using managed PostgreSQL services if available in Thailand region.

# Test Strategy:
Validate database setup with connection tests in both local Docker and Kubernetes environments. Test spatial query performance. Verify backup and restore procedures. Test replication failover scenarios. Validate PostGIS functions with sample spatial data. Benchmark query performance under load. Test database migrations. Ensure port 5432 is properly exposed and accessible in both environments.
