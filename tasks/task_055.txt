# Task ID: 55
# Title: Implement Water Control BFF Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 9, 10, 13, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a specialized Backend-for-Frontend service for real-time water control operations, including gate control, pump management, and emergency response interfaces.
# Details:
Create Water Control BFF using Node.js/TypeScript with Express.js or NestJS. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time control updates and status monitoring. Create command APIs for gate operations (open/close/set position) with safety validations. Implement pump control endpoints with start/stop sequences and safety interlocks. Add real-time telemetry streaming for water levels, flow rates, and gate positions. Create emergency override APIs with proper authorization and audit logging. Implement control loop feedback APIs for automated control systems. Add support for manual override modes with operator tracking. Create batch control APIs for zone-wide operations. Implement predictive control interfaces for AI-based recommendations. Add alarm and alert aggregation from SCADA systems. Create mobile-optimized endpoints for field operator devices. Implement offline command queueing for unreliable network conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebSocket connections for real-time updates. Verify gate control commands with safety validations. Test pump control sequences and interlocks. Validate telemetry data streaming performance. Test emergency override authorization and logging. Verify control loop feedback accuracy. Test manual override tracking. Validate batch operations across multiple devices. Test offline command queueing and synchronization. Verify mobile endpoint optimization.
