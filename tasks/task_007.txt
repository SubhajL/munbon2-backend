# Task ID: 7
# Title: Setup TimescaleDB for Time-Series Data
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and configure TimescaleDB for efficient storage and querying of time-series sensor data.
# Details:
Deploy TimescaleDB (v2.10+) as an extension to PostgreSQL. Configure hypertables for time-series data partitioning. Set up continuous aggregates for efficient querying. Implement data retention policies. Configure compression for historical data. Set up proper indexing strategies for time-series queries. Implement connection pooling. Configure automated backups. Optimize TimescaleDB configuration for sensor data workloads. Consider multi-node TimescaleDB for horizontal scaling if data volume requires it.

# Test Strategy:
Validate TimescaleDB setup with connection tests. Test hypertable creation and querying. Benchmark time-series query performance. Test continuous aggregates functionality. Verify compression ratios. Test data retention policies. Validate backup and restore procedures.
