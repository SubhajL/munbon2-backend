# Title: Implement WebSocket Service for Real-time Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 10, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop WebSocket service for real-time data updates, notifications, and streaming.
# Details:
Implement WebSocket service using Socket.IO (v4.6+) or native WebSockets. Develop authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections. Create channels/rooms for different data streams. Implement message serialization using JSON or MessagePack. Set up connection pooling and load balancing. Develop heartbeat mechanism for connection health. Implement reconnection strategies. Configure proper error handling and logging. Consider using Redis adapter for horizontal scaling of WebSocket servers.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebSocket connections with sample clients. Validate authentication and authorization. Test message delivery to specific channels. Verify reconnection functionality. Benchmark WebSocket server performance under load. Test error handling scenarios. Validate horizontal scaling with multiple instances.
