# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement AI Model Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the AI Model Service for TensorFlow model serving, versioning, and inference endpoints.
# Details:
Deploy TensorFlow Serving (v2.12+) for model serving. Implement model versioning and deployment pipelines. Create real-time inference endpoints using gRPC and REST. Develop batch prediction capabilities. Implement model performance monitoring with Prometheus. Set up feature engineering pipelines using TensorFlow Transform or scikit-learn. Configure model storage and versioning using MLflow or TensorFlow Extended (TFX). Implement A/B testing capabilities for model evaluation. Consider using ONNX Runtime for model interoperability if multiple frameworks are used.

# Test Strategy:
Test model serving with sample models. Validate inference endpoints with test data. Benchmark inference performance under load. Test model versioning and rollback. Verify batch prediction functionality. Test feature engineering pipelines. Validate model monitoring metrics.
