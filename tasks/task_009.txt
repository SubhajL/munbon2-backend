Implement Schema Registry using Confluent Schema Registry for data governance. Configure appropriate topic partitioning and replication. Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Implement proper security with TLS and SASL. Define event schemas using Avro or Protobuf. Configure retention policies for different event types. Consider using managed Kafka services if available in Thailand region.
