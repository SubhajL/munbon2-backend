# Task ID: 66
# Title: Integrate ROS/GIS Services with Flow Monitoring for Mixed Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 23, 50, 59, 60
# Priority: high
# Description: Create unified integration layer connecting ROS crop water requirements and GIS spatial data with Flow Monitoring Service for both automated real-time and manual batch operations.
# Details:
Develop integration service that bridges ROS/GIS section-level demands with Flow Monitoring's dual-mode capabilities. Implement section-level (not plot-level) demand aggregation from ROS based on crop types, growth stages, and weather conditions. Create spatial mapping service linking GIS section boundaries to hydraulic delivery points. Build demand forecasting for weekly batch planning while maintaining real-time adjustment capability. Implement priority-based scheduling considering crop criticality, soil moisture, and growth stages. Create conflict resolution for competing demands considering both automated gate capacity and manual operation constraints. Develop feedback loop updating ROS crop models based on actual deliveries. Build weather integration adjusting demands based on rainfall and ET forecasts. Implement emergency override protocols for drought or flood conditions. Create performance analytics comparing planned vs delivered water at section level.

# Test Strategy:
Test demand aggregation at section level. Verify GIS to hydraulic point mapping. Test weekly forecasting accuracy. Validate real-time adjustment protocols. Test priority-based scheduling logic. Verify conflict resolution algorithms. Test feedback loop updates to ROS. Validate weather-based adjustments. Test emergency override protocols. Verify performance analytics accuracy.
