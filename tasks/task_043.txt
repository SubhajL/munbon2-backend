# Task ID: 43
# Title: Implement Web BFF Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a specialized Backend-for-Frontend service optimized for web applications, providing tailored APIs for web dashboards, admin panels, and monitoring interfaces with support for real-time updates and complex data visualizations.
# Details:
Build Web BFF using Node.js/TypeScript with Express.js or NestJS. Implement RESTful APIs optimized for web dashboard requirements. Create Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket endpoints for real-time dashboard updates. Implement data aggregation for complex dashboard widgets combining data from multiple microservices. Add support for large dataset exports (CSV, Excel, PDF). Create specialized endpoints for data visualization libraries (time-series data, geospatial data, charts). Implement server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting for data tables. Add role-based data filtering for different user types. Create dashboard template APIs for customizable dashboards. Implement session management optimized for web browsers. Add CORS configuration for web security. Create batch APIs for bulk operations from web admin panels.

# Test Strategy:
Test REST API performance with large datasets. Verify real-time updates via SSE/WebSocket. Test data aggregation accuracy. Validate export functionality for various formats. Test pagination and filtering with complex queries. Verify role-based access control. Load test with concurrent web sessions. Test CORS configuration. Validate session management across multiple browser tabs.
