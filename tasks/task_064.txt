# Task ID: 64
# Title: Implement Gravity Flow Optimizer for Mixed Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 50, 59
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop optimization system for gravity-fed network that coordinates automated gates for fine control with manual gates for major routing decisions.
# Details:
Create hydraulic optimizer specifically for gravity flow constraints considering bed slopes, minimum depths, and travel times. Implement elevation-based feasibility checking ensuring all sections can receive water by gravity. Develop optimal flow splitting algorithms using automated gates for precise control while manual gates handle major routing. Calculate minimum operating depths required to maintain flow throughout the network. Build travel time predictor accounting for varying flow rates and channel conditions. Implement sequencing optimizer determining optimal order for zone deliveries to minimize water residence time. Create energy recovery calculator identifying potential micro-hydro locations at automated gates. Develop contingency routing when primary paths are blocked. Build visualization showing elevation profiles and flow possibilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test feasibility checking with various demand scenarios. Verify flow splitting algorithm accuracy. Test minimum depth calculations. Validate travel time predictions against historical data. Test sequencing optimization logic. Verify energy recovery calculations. Test contingency routing algorithms. Validate elevation profile visualizations.
