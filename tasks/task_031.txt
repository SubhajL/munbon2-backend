# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement Maintenance Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a microservice for managing equipment maintenance schedules, maintenance history, preventive maintenance alerts, work order management, and maintenance cost tracking for all irrigation infrastructure.
# Details:
Implement the Maintenance Service using Spring Boot (v3.0+) or NestJS (v10+) with the following components:

1. Core Modules:
   - Maintenance Schedule Management: Create APIs for defining maintenance schedules based on equipment type, usage patterns, and manufacturer recommendations
   - Maintenance History: Implement endpoints for recording completed maintenance activities with details like technician, parts replaced, and observations
   - Work Order Management: Develop functionality for creating, assigning, tracking, and closing maintenance work orders
   - Preventive Maintenance: Build algorithms to generate alerts based on usage metrics, time intervals, and sensor data
   - Cost Tracking: Implement a system to track and report on maintenance costs by equipment, region, or maintenance type

2. Database Design:
   - Create schemas in PostgreSQL for maintenance_schedules, maintenance_history, work_orders, and maintenance_costs tables
   - Implement spatial queries using PostGIS to locate equipment by geographic region
   - Design efficient indexing for time-series data related to maintenance history

3. Integration Points:
   - Connect to Notification Service for sending maintenance alerts and work order assignments
   - Implement Kafka producers/consumers for event-driven updates (equipment status changes, sensor readings)
   - Expose RESTful APIs through the API Gateway for client applications
   - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed maintenance schedules and equipment data

4. Advanced Features:
   - Implement predictive maintenance algorithms using historical data
   - Create dashboards for maintenance KPIs (MTBF, MTTR, maintenance costs)
   - Develop mobile-friendly APIs for field technicians to update work orders
   - Build reporting functionality for maintenance cost analysis

5. Security Considerations:
   - Implement role-based access control for different maintenance personnel
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization through the API Gateway
   - Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement database query optimization for large maintenance history datasets
   - Use appropriate caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Design efficient batch processing for preventive maintenance calculations

Use Docker for containerization and ensure the service is configured for Kubernetes deployment with appropriate health checks, resource limits, and scaling policies.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all service components using JUnit/Jest with 80%+ code coverage
   - Create mock objects for external dependencies (notification service, database)
   - Test edge cases for maintenance scheduling algorithms and cost calculations

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test database interactions with test containers or embedded PostgreSQL
   - Verify Kafka message production and consumption with embedded Kafka
   - Test integration with the Notification Service using mock servers

3. API Testing:
   - Create Postman/Newman test collections for all API endpoints
   - Test API authentication and authorization through the API Gateway
   - Verify proper error handling and response codes for various scenarios

4. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load tests using JMeter or k6 to ensure the service can handle expected load
   - Test database query performance with large datasets
   - Verify caching effectiveness under load

5. Functional Testing:
   - Verify maintenance schedule creation and modification
   - Test work order lifecycle from creation to completion
   - Validate preventive maintenance alert generation
   - Confirm maintenance cost tracking and reporting accuracy

6. End-to-End Testing:
   - Test the complete maintenance workflow from schedule creation to work order completion
   - Verify notifications are sent correctly for maintenance alerts
   - Test mobile interfaces for field technicians

7. Deployment Testing:
   - Verify Kubernetes deployment with proper resource allocation
   - Test service resilience with simulated failures
   - Validate proper metrics collection for monitoring

Document all test cases and results in the project's test management system and ensure CI/CD pipeline includes automated tests.
