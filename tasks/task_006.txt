# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement GIS Data Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the GIS Data Service for spatial data operations, vector tile generation, and integration with government WMTS services.
# Details:
Implement GIS service using Spring Boot (v3.0+) or NestJS (v10+). Integrate with PostGIS for spatial operations. Implement vector tile generation using Tegola or t-rex. Create GeoJSON API endpoints following OGC standards. Set up real-time spatial data updates using WebSockets. Integrate with Thailand government WMTS services via their official APIs. Implement spatial queries and analysis functions. Use JTS Topology Suite or GEOS for complex spatial operations. Configure proper caching for tile serving. Consider using GeoServer for advanced GIS functionality if needed. Implement proper spatial indexing for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test spatial operations. Test vector tile generation and serving. Validate GeoJSON API responses. Test integration with government WMTS services. Benchmark spatial query performance. Test real-time updates. Validate spatial analysis functions with known datasets.
