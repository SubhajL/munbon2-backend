# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 51, 12, 50
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a Model Predictive Control microservice for advanced real-time control of irrigation systems using predictive models and rolling horizon optimization.
# Details:
Create MPC Service using Python with control theory libraries (python-control, do-mpc). Implement system identification for irrigation network dynamics. Develop state-space models for canal hydraulics. Create predictive models using historical data and physics. Implement receding horizon optimization with constraints. Handle multi-variable control with coupled dynamics. Implement disturbance rejection for weather variations. Create adaptive MPC for changing system parameters. Integrate real-time sensor feedback for model updates. Implement robust MPC for uncertainty handling. Store control performance metrics. Create visualization for predicted vs actual trajectories. Support different MPC formulations (linear, nonlinear, stochastic).

# Test Strategy:
Test system identification accuracy. Verify predictive model performance. Test optimization convergence within time constraints. Validate control stability under disturbances. Test adaptive capabilities with parameter changes. Verify constraint satisfaction in control actions. Test robustness to model uncertainties. Validate real-time performance requirements.
