# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Data Integration Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a microservice for ETL operations, data transformation, third-party data integration, data validation, data mapping, and managing data flows between different systems and formats.
# Details:
1. Technology Stack:
   - Use Spring Boot (v3.0+) or NestJS (v10+) for the service implementation
   - Implement Apache Camel (v4.0+) or Spring Integration for ETL pipelines
   - Use Apache Avro or Protocol Buffers for schema definition
   - Utilize MongoDB (v6.0+) or PostgreSQL (v15+) for metadata storage

2. Core Components:
   - Data Source Connectors: Implement adapters for various data sources (REST APIs, databases, file systems, Kafka topics)
   - Transformation Engine: Create a pipeline for data transformation with support for mapping, filtering, aggregation, and enrichment
   - Data Validation Framework: Implement JSON Schema or custom validation rules for data quality checks
   - Data Mapping Service: Develop a service for mapping between different data models and formats
   - Workflow Orchestrator: Create a workflow engine to manage complex data integration processes

3. Integration Points:
   - Connect with the File Processing Service for handling file-based data sources
   - Integrate with Kafka for event-driven data processing and publishing transformation results
   - Register all endpoints with the API Gateway for external access
   - Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms for resilient integration

4. Features:
   - Batch Processing: Support for scheduled and on-demand batch processing jobs
   - Real-time Processing: Stream processing capabilities for continuous data integration
   - Data Lineage: Track data origin and transformation history
   - Error Handling: Comprehensive error management with dead-letter queues and retry mechanisms
   - Monitoring: Expose metrics for Prometheus integration
   - Logging: Structured logging with correlation IDs for traceability

5. Security:
   - Implement data encryption for sensitive information
   - Set up authentication and authorization for integration endpoints
   - Ensure secure storage of connection credentials using Kubernetes secrets

6. Performance Considerations:
   - Implement backpressure mechanisms for handling high-volume data flows
   - Design for horizontal scalability
   - Use connection pooling for database connections
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed reference data

7. Documentation:
   - Create OpenAPI specifications for all REST endpoints
   - Document data models and transformation rules
   - Provide examples for common integration scenarios

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for all transformation logic using JUnit/Jest with at least 80% code coverage
   - Create mock objects for external dependencies
   - Test validation rules with both valid and invalid data samples
   - Verify error handling mechanisms

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up integration tests with test containers for database and Kafka dependencies
   - Test complete ETL pipelines with sample data
   - Verify correct data flow between components
   - Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
   - Validate data mapping accuracy between different formats

3. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load tests to verify throughput capabilities
   - Measure latency for different types of transformations
   - Test with large datasets to verify memory management
   - Verify horizontal scaling capabilities

4. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create automated tests that verify integration with File Processing Service
   - Test data flow through Kafka topics
   - Verify API Gateway integration
   - Test complete workflows involving multiple systems

5. Validation Criteria:
   - All unit and integration tests must pass
   - Performance tests must meet defined SLAs (e.g., process 1000 records/second)
   - Data transformation must maintain accuracy with zero data loss
   - System must handle failure scenarios gracefully with proper error reporting
   - All endpoints must be accessible through the API Gateway
   - Monitoring dashboards must show relevant metrics

6. Manual Testing:
   - Verify data lineage tracking for complex transformations
   - Test integration with third-party systems
   - Validate monitoring and alerting functionality
