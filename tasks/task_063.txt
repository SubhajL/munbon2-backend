# Task ID: 63
# Title: Create Section-Level Water Accounting with Mixed Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 50, 59
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive water accounting system at section level that tracks deliveries through both automated and manual gates with weekly reconciliation.
# Details:
Build water accounting system aggregating flow data from automated gates (continuous measurement) and manual gates (estimated from gate settings and hydraulic models). Implement section-level volume calculators integrating real-time flow data where available and model-based estimates elsewhere. Create delivery tracking comparing planned vs actual volumes. Develop loss detection algorithms identifying discrepancies between upstream releases and downstream receipts. Build weekly reconciliation process combining automated data, manual readings, and field observations. Implement efficiency metrics for each section considering soil type, crop requirements, and delivery method. Create audit trails tracking all water movements with confidence levels. Generate reports for water user associations and regulatory compliance. Build predictive models improving future delivery estimates based on historical performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test volume calculations with mixed data sources. Verify integration of real-time and estimated flows. Test delivery tracking accuracy. Validate loss detection algorithms. Test weekly reconciliation process. Verify efficiency metric calculations. Test audit trail completeness. Validate regulatory report generation. Test predictive model accuracy.
