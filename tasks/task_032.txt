# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Alert Management Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a dedicated microservice for managing all system alerts, alarm configurations, alert rules, alert history, acknowledgment workflows, and integration with notification service for alert dispatching.
# Details:
1. Architecture and Setup:
   - Develop the Alert Management Service using Spring Boot (v3.0+) or NestJS (v10+)
   - Containerize the service using Docker with appropriate health checks
   - Deploy to Kubernetes with proper resource configurations
   - Configure service discovery and registration with API Gateway

2. Core Alert Management Features:
   - Implement alert definition and configuration management with support for:
     - Threshold-based alerts (numeric values exceeding thresholds)
     - Pattern-based alerts (log pattern matching)
     - Anomaly detection alerts (statistical deviations)
     - Heartbeat/availability alerts (service health monitoring)
   - Create RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on alert configurations
   - Implement alert rule engine with support for complex conditions and Boolean logic
   - Design and implement alert severity levels (Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
   - Develop alert categorization system (System, Application, Security, Business, etc.)

3. Alert Processing Pipeline:
   - Implement Kafka consumers to receive events from various system components
   - Develop real-time alert evaluation engine to process incoming events against alert rules
   - Create alert enrichment system to add contextual information to alerts
   - Implement alert deduplication and correlation to reduce alert noise
   - Design and implement alert throttling mechanisms to prevent alert storms

4. Alert Storage and History:
   - Design database schema for alert storage (using MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
   - Implement alert lifecycle management (New, Acknowledged, Resolved, Closed)
   - Create alert history and audit trail functionality
   - Implement time-based retention policies for alert history
   - Develop alert analytics and reporting capabilities

5. Alert Notification Integration:
   - Integrate with Notification Service for alert dispatching
   - Implement alert routing based on severity, category, and team assignments
   - Create alert escalation workflows with time-based triggers
   - Develop on-call rotation integration for alert assignment
   - Implement acknowledgment tracking and follow-up reminders

6. User Interface APIs:
   - Create APIs for alert dashboard visualization
   - Implement APIs for alert filtering, sorting, and searching
   - Develop APIs for alert acknowledgment and resolution
   - Create APIs for alert configuration management

7. Performance and Scalability:
   - Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed alert configurations
   - Design for horizontal scalability to handle high alert volumes
   - Implement proper indexing strategies for alert queries
   - Configure appropriate Kafka partitioning for alert event topics

8. Security:
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization for alert management APIs
   - Ensure secure storage of sensitive alert configuration data
   - Implement audit logging for all alert configuration changes
   - Configure appropriate RBAC for alert management operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for alert rule evaluation logic
   - Test alert deduplication and correlation algorithms
   - Validate alert lifecycle state transitions
   - Test alert routing and escalation logic
   - Verify alert configuration validation rules

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with Kafka for event consumption
   - Verify integration with Notification Service for alert dispatching
   - Test Redis caching functionality for alert configurations
   - Validate API Gateway routing to the Alert Management Service
   - Test database interactions for alert storage and retrieval

3. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load testing to verify handling of high alert volumes (1000+ alerts/minute)
   - Test alert rule evaluation performance under load
   - Measure and optimize alert storage and retrieval performance
   - Verify Redis caching effectiveness under load
   - Test Kafka consumer group performance for event processing

4. Functional Testing:
   - Verify all alert types (threshold, pattern, anomaly, heartbeat) function correctly
   - Test alert configuration CRUD operations through APIs
   - Validate alert acknowledgment and resolution workflows
   - Test alert filtering, sorting, and searching functionality
   - Verify alert history and audit trail accuracy

5. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create test scenarios that generate alerts from various system components
   - Verify complete alert lifecycle from generation to notification to resolution
   - Test alert escalation workflows with timing verification
   - Validate alert dashboard visualization data accuracy
   - Test on-call rotation and alert assignment functionality

6. Security Testing:
   - Verify proper authentication and authorization for all APIs
   - Test RBAC permissions for different user roles
   - Validate audit logging for configuration changes
   - Verify secure storage of sensitive alert data

7. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All alert types can be configured, triggered, and processed correctly
   - Alerts are properly routed to the Notification Service for dispatching
   - Alert deduplication and correlation effectively reduces alert noise
   - Alert dashboard APIs provide accurate and timely information
   - Alert history and audit trails are complete and accurate
   - System can handle the expected alert volume with acceptable latency
   - Alert acknowledgment and resolution workflows function correctly
