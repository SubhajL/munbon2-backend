# Title: Create Weekly Batch Scheduler with Real-time Adaptation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 50, 59
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an intelligent scheduler that plans weekly batch operations while continuously adapting based on real-time data from automated gates and sensors.
# Details:
Build a hybrid scheduling system that creates optimal weekly water delivery plans while maintaining flexibility for real-time adjustments. Implement section-level demand aggregation from ROS/GIS services. Create optimization algorithm balancing water needs, canal capacity, manual operation constraints, and automated gate capabilities. Generate weekly batch schedules with specific time windows for manual operations. Implement real-time schedule adaptation based on automated gate feedback and sensor readings. Create contingency planning for weather events. Build schedule conflict resolution considering both manual team availability and automated gate status. Implement rolling wave planning updating future schedules based on actual deliveries. Generate synchronized instructions for both field teams and SCADA system. Create schedule performance tracking and continuous improvement algorithms.

# Test Strategy:
Test demand aggregation with various crop scenarios. Verify optimization algorithm with capacity constraints. Test schedule generation for different seasonal patterns. Validate real-time adaptation with simulated sensor data. Test contingency handling for rain events. Verify conflict resolution algorithms. Test rolling wave planning updates. Validate synchronized instruction generation. Test performance tracking metrics.
