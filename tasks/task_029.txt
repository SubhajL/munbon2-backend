# Title: Implement Scheduling Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a microservice for managing irrigation schedules, maintenance schedules, automated task scheduling, cron job management, and schedule optimization based on water availability and demand.

   - Develop WebSocket endpoints for real-time schedule updates
   - Create batch operations for bulk schedule management

7. Integration Points:
   - Implement Kafka consumers/producers for event-driven scheduling
   - Develop Redis integration for caching and distributed coordination
   - Create integration with Water Distribution Control Service for flow coordination

   - Develop validation rules to prevent invalid schedules
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

9. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Set up Prometheus metrics for schedule execution statistics
   - Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
   - Create custom health checks for scheduler components
   - Develop alerting for schedule execution failures

10. Documentation and Testing:
    - Create comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
    - Develop integration tests for all scheduling scenarios
    - Implement performance tests for schedule optimization algorithms
    - Create user documentation for schedule management

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark schedule optimization algorithms with large datasets
   - Test concurrent schedule creation and modification
   - Measure latency of schedule execution triggers
   - Verify system behavior under high scheduling load

4. Functional Testing:
   - Verify creation, modification, and deletion of different schedule types
   - Test schedule execution with simulated time advancement
   - Validate schedule priority handling and conflict resolution
   - Test schedule adaptation based on simulated sensor data changes

5. Reliability Testing:
   - Test system recovery after service restart
   - Verify schedule persistence across system failures
   - Test behavior during network partitioning
   - Validate schedule execution during partial system outages

6. Security Testing:
   - Verify role-based access controls for schedule management
   - Test API endpoint security and authentication
   - Validate input sanitization for schedule parameters

   - Test schedule visualization and reporting features

8. Acceptance Testing:
   - Develop user acceptance test scripts for schedule management
   - Create demonstration scenarios for stakeholder review
   - Test schedule management through all available interfaces
   - Validate schedule execution results match expected outcomes
