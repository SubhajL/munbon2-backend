# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Analytics Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 16, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a microservice for data analytics, performance metrics calculation, water usage statistics, efficiency analysis, trend analysis, and generating insights for decision support.
# Details:
1. Architecture and Setup:

   - Deploy as a containerized microservice on Kubernetes
   - Configure service discovery and API gateway integration
   - Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms for resilience

2. Data Integration:
   - Develop connectors to TimescaleDB for time-series sensor data analysis
   - Implement InfluxDB integration for performance metrics processing
   - Create data pipelines for extracting and transforming data from multiple sources
   - Implement data synchronization mechanisms with appropriate consistency models

3. Analytics Engine:
   - Develop core analytics engine with pluggable algorithm architecture
   - Implement statistical analysis modules (mean, median, variance, outlier detection)
   - Create time-series analysis components (trend detection, seasonality, forecasting)
   - Implement machine learning pipeline for predictive analytics using Spring AI or TensorFlow
   - Develop anomaly detection algorithms for identifying unusual water usage patterns

4. Performance Metrics:
   - Implement KPI calculation modules for water system efficiency
   - Create water usage analytics with geographic distribution analysis
   - Develop comparative analytics (historical, regional, benchmark-based)
   - Implement resource optimization algorithms

5. API Development:
   - Design and implement RESTful APIs for analytics consumption
   - Create GraphQL endpoint for flexible data querying
   - Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time analytics updates
   - Develop batch processing endpoints for scheduled analysis tasks

6. Caching and Performance:
   - Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed analytics results
   - Configure appropriate TTL for different types of analytics data
   - Implement background calculation and pre-computation of expensive analytics

7. Integration with Reporting:
   - Develop integration with the Reporting Service for analytics-based reports
   - Implement data transformation for dashboard visualizations
   - Create exportable analytics datasets in various formats

8. Security:
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization for analytics endpoints
   - Apply data masking for sensitive information in analytics results
   - Implement audit logging for analytics queries

9. Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Document analytics algorithms and methodologies
   - Provide usage examples and integration patterns

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all analytics algorithms and calculations
   - Implement parameterized tests for statistical functions with known datasets and expected results
   - Test edge cases (empty datasets, outliers, missing data points)
   - Mock external dependencies (databases, other services)

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with TimescaleDB using testcontainers
   - Verify InfluxDB data retrieval and processing
   - Test integration with the Reporting Service using mock services
   - Validate data transformation pipelines with sample datasets

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark analytics operations with large datasets (>1M records)
   - Test concurrent analytics requests under load (JMeter or Gatling)
   - Measure and optimize response times for different analytics operations
   - Verify caching effectiveness with repeated queries

4. Validation Testing:
   - Validate statistical calculations against known reference implementations
   - Cross-check analytics results with manual calculations for sample datasets
   - Verify trend analysis with historical data having known patterns
   - Validate forecasting accuracy using historical data splits (training/testing)

5. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create automated test scenarios for complete analytics workflows
   - Test dashboard data generation and visualization
   - Verify report generation with embedded analytics
   - Test real-time analytics updates via WebSocket connections

6. Security Testing:
   - Verify proper authentication and authorization for analytics endpoints
   - Test data masking for sensitive information
   - Perform penetration testing on analytics APIs

7. Acceptance Testing:
   - Develop user acceptance test scripts for business stakeholders
   - Create test datasets representing real-world scenarios
   - Validate analytics insights against domain expert expectations
   - Verify decision support capabilities with business use cases
