# Description: Develop an advanced optimization microservice using mathematical programming and metaheuristics to optimize water distribution, minimize losses, and maximize irrigation efficiency.
# Details:
Build Optimization Service using Python with optimization libraries (PuLP, Gurobi, OR-Tools). Implement linear programming for water allocation optimization. Create mixed-integer programming for pump scheduling. Implement genetic algorithms for multi-objective optimization. Develop particle swarm optimization for real-time adjustments. Create constraint satisfaction for regulatory compliance. Implement stochastic optimization for uncertainty handling. Integrate with forecast data for predictive optimization. Create scenario analysis capabilities. Implement distributed optimization for large-scale problems. Store optimization results and performance metrics. Create APIs for optimization triggers and result retrieval. Support both batch and real-time optimization modes.

# Test Strategy:
Test optimization algorithms with benchmark problems. Verify constraint satisfaction in solutions. Test scalability with large problem instances. Validate solution quality against manual planning. Test real-time optimization performance. Verify integration with forecast services. Test scenario analysis features. Validate distributed optimization coordination.
