# Title: Setup InfluxDB for Metrics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up and configure InfluxDB for storing system metrics, performance data, and monitoring information.
# Details:
Deploy InfluxDB (v2.6+) on Kubernetes. Configure proper storage classes for persistence. Set up retention policies for different metric types. Implement Telegraf agents for metric collection. Configure Flux queries for data analysis. Set up continuous queries for data downsampling. Implement proper authentication and authorization. Configure backup procedures. Consider using InfluxDB Cloud if managed services are preferred.

# Test Strategy:
Validate InfluxDB setup with connection tests. Test metric ingestion with Telegraf. Verify retention policies. Benchmark write and query performance. Test continuous queries. Validate backup and restore procedures. Test authentication and authorization.
