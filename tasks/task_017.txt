# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement System Monitoring Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the System Monitoring Service for health checks, metrics collection, distributed tracing, and alerting.
# Details:
Deploy Prometheus (v2.45+) for metrics collection. Set up Grafana (v10.0+) for dashboards and visualization. Implement Jaeger (v1.45+) or Zipkin for distributed tracing. Configure OpenTelemetry for instrumentation. Set up ELK stack (Elasticsearch 8.x, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation. Implement health check endpoints for all services. Create alert rules in Prometheus Alertmanager. Develop custom exporters for application-specific metrics. Implement resource usage monitoring with node_exporter. Configure PagerDuty or similar service for alert notifications.

# Test Strategy:
Validate Prometheus metric collection. Test Grafana dashboard functionality. Verify distributed tracing with test transactions. Test health check endpoints. Validate alert rules with simulated conditions. Test log aggregation and search. Benchmark monitoring system performance under load.
