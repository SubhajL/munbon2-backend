# Task ID: 62
# Title: Develop Hybrid Sensor Network Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 50
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create intelligent system for managing limited sensors (6 water level + 1 moisture) across both continuous monitoring for automated gates and validation for manual operations.
# Details:
Implement sensor allocation optimizer that balances real-time monitoring needs for automated control with weekly validation requirements for manual operations. Create sensor mobility scheduler determining optimal placement for each week based on previous performance data and upcoming delivery schedules. Build sensor-to-section mapping using GPS coordinates and GIS integration. Implement data interpolation algorithms estimating conditions at ungauged locations using hydraulic models. Create confidence scoring for interpolated values. Develop adaptive calibration using mobile sensor readings to continuously improve fixed-point estimates. Build anomaly detection distinguishing sensor malfunctions from actual hydraulic anomalies. Implement data fusion combining sensor readings with manual observations from field teams. Create visualization dashboard showing sensor coverage and data confidence levels.

# Test Strategy:
Test sensor allocation algorithms with various scenarios. Verify GPS-based section mapping accuracy. Test interpolation algorithms against known values. Validate confidence scoring methodology. Test adaptive calibration with simulated sensor movements. Verify anomaly detection accuracy. Test data fusion with manual observations. Validate visualization dashboard functionality.
