# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Mobile BFF Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 8, 13, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a specialized Backend-for-Frontend service optimized for mobile applications, providing tailored APIs, data aggregation, and mobile-specific features like offline sync and push notifications.
# Details:
Create Mobile BFF using Node.js/TypeScript with Express.js or NestJS. Implement GraphQL endpoint optimized for mobile data fetching patterns. Create data aggregation layer to combine multiple microservice calls into single mobile-optimized responses. Implement response caching with Redis for frequently accessed data. Add offline sync support using conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs). Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for push notifications. Implement data compression and pagination for bandwidth efficiency. Create mobile-specific authentication flow with biometric support. Add image optimization and lazy loading support. Implement request batching to reduce network calls. Create versioned APIs to support multiple mobile app versions. Add telemetry for mobile app analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Test GraphQL query optimization. Verify data aggregation from multiple services. Test offline sync scenarios with conflict resolution. Validate push notification delivery. Test response compression and pagination. Verify mobile authentication flows. Load test with simulated mobile traffic patterns. Test API versioning compatibility. Validate bandwidth optimization features.
