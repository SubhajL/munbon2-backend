## Key Design Principles

1. **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Every component supports both real-time automated and batch manual operations

2. **Section-Level Focus**: Aggregate from plots to sections (50-200 hectares each)

3. **Mixed Control**: 20 automated gates provide fine control, manual gates handle major routing

4. **Limited Sensors**: Design assumes only 6 water level + 1 moisture sensor (mobile)

5. **Gravity Fed**: All optimization must respect elevation constraints and bed slopes

6. **Weekly Cycles**: Batch operations organized into 1-2 field days per week

7. **Synchronization**: Automated and manual operations must not conflict

8. **Confidence Levels**: All interpolated/modeled values include confidence scores
