# Task ID: 50
# Title: Implement Flow/Volume/Level Monitoring Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 7, 16, 46
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an integrated microservice for comprehensive hydraulic monitoring including flow rates, water volumes, and levels across the entire irrigation network with advanced analytics.
# Details:
Create Flow/Volume/Level Service using Python/FastAPI for numerical computations. Implement multi-parameter sensor fusion for accurate measurements. Calculate instantaneous flow rates from various sensor types (ultrasonic, electromagnetic, mechanical). Compute cumulative volumes with integration algorithms. Implement hydraulic modeling for flow estimation in ungauged locations. Create water balance calculations for loss detection. Implement anomaly detection for sensor malfunctions or leaks. Store high-frequency data in InfluxDB for real-time analytics. Create aggregated data views in TimescaleDB. Implement predictive analytics for flow forecasting. Generate hydraulic efficiency reports. Create APIs for complex hydraulic queries and visualizations.

# Test Strategy:
Test sensor fusion algorithms with multiple data sources. Verify flow calculation accuracy against calibrated meters. Test volume integration over time periods. Validate hydraulic modeling predictions. Test anomaly detection with simulated failures. Verify water balance calculations. Test predictive analytics accuracy. Validate API performance for complex queries.
