# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement BFF (Backend for Frontend) Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a specialized backend service that aggregates data from multiple microservices, optimizes API calls for frontend consumption, handles frontend-specific business logic, and provides tailored endpoints for web and mobile clients.
# Details:
1. Technology Stack:
   - Use Node.js (v18+) with Express.js or NestJS framework for the BFF implementation
   - Implement GraphQL using Apollo Server (v4+) for flexible data fetching
   - Set up Redis (v7.0+) for response caching and performance optimization

2. Service Architecture:
   - Create separate BFF instances for web and mobile clients with shared core functionality
   - Implement the Backend-For-Frontend pattern with clear separation of concerns
   - Design the service to be stateless for horizontal scalability
   - Configure proper health checks and readiness probes for Kubernetes

3. API Aggregation:
   - Develop client-specific data aggregation from GIS, Sensor, SCADA, AI, and Water Distribution services
   - Implement parallel request handling using Promise.all() for performance optimization
   - Create composite endpoints that combine data from multiple microservices
   - Implement request batching to reduce network overhead

4. Authentication & Authorization:
   - Integrate with the Authentication Service for token validation and user context
   - Implement role-based access control for frontend-specific operations
   - Handle token refresh and session management for frontend clients
   - Provide user context enrichment for personalized experiences

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement response caching strategies with proper cache invalidation
   - Use HTTP/2 for multiplexed connections to backend services
   - Implement request collapsing for duplicate requests
   - Configure timeout and retry policies for resilience

6. Frontend-Specific Logic:
   - Implement data transformation and formatting specific to UI requirements
   - Create view models that optimize data structure for frontend consumption
   - Implement client-side pagination, sorting, and filtering logic
   - Develop specialized endpoints for dashboard widgets and visualizations

7. Mobile-Specific Considerations:
   - Implement response payload optimization for mobile bandwidth constraints
   - Create specialized endpoints for offline-first capabilities
   - Configure compression for mobile data transfer efficiency
   - Implement push notification integration for real-time alerts

8. Error Handling:
   - Develop consistent error response format for frontend consumption
   - Implement graceful degradation when backend services are unavailable
   - Create detailed logging for frontend-related issues
   - Implement circuit breakers for unreliable downstream services

9. Documentation:
   - Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for REST endpoints
   - Create GraphQL schema documentation with examples
   - Document caching strategies and invalidation patterns
   - Provide frontend integration examples for common use cases

10. Monitoring and Observability:
    - Implement detailed request tracing with correlation IDs
    - Set up performance metrics collection for frontend-specific operations
    - Configure alerts for degraded user experience
    - Implement synthetic monitoring for critical user journeys

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all data transformation and aggregation logic
   - Implement mock services for all downstream microservices
   - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Verify caching behavior with mock Redis instances

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up integration tests with actual downstream services in a test environment
   - Test authentication flow with the Auth service
   - Verify correct data aggregation from multiple services
   - Test performance under various load conditions

3. Contract Testing:
   - Implement consumer-driven contract tests using Pact or similar tools
   - Verify compatibility with frontend applications
   - Test API versioning and backward compatibility
   - Ensure schema changes don't break frontend functionality

4. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load testing to verify response times under expected traffic
   - Test caching efficiency and hit rates
   - Measure memory usage and potential leaks
   - Verify connection pooling behavior with downstream services

5. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing focused on API security
   - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Verify proper handling of sensitive data
   - Check for common API vulnerabilities (OWASP API Top 10)

6. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create automated E2E tests for critical user journeys
   - Test with actual frontend applications (web and mobile)
   - Verify correct rendering of aggregated data
   - Test offline capabilities and synchronization for mobile clients

7. Chaos Testing:
   - Simulate downstream service failures and verify graceful degradation
   - Test circuit breaker behavior under various failure scenarios
   - Verify timeout and retry policies
   - Test recovery after service disruptions

8. Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct user acceptance testing with frontend developers
   - Verify that all frontend requirements are met
   - Test real-world scenarios with production-like data
   - Validate response formats and structure for frontend consumption

9. Monitoring Verification:
   - Verify that all monitoring and observability features are working
   - Test alert configurations with simulated failures
   - Verify log aggregation and correlation
   - Test dashboard visualizations for BFF metrics
