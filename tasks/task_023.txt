# Title: Implement Data Backup and Disaster Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 11, 14, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive data backup, restoration, and disaster recovery procedures.
# Details:
Implement automated backup procedures for all databases (PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, MongoDB, Redis, InfluxDB). Configure point-in-time recovery capabilities. Set up off-site backup storage. Implement backup validation and testing procedures. Develop disaster recovery runbooks. Configure multi-region replication where applicable. Implement backup encryption for security. Set up monitoring and alerting for backup jobs. Consider using Velero for Kubernetes resource backups.

# Test Strategy:
Test backup procedures for all databases. Validate restoration from backups. Verify point-in-time recovery functionality. Test disaster recovery procedures with simulated failures. Validate backup encryption and security. Test multi-region failover where applicable. Verify monitoring and alerting for backup jobs.
