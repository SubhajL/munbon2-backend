# Task ID: 37
# Title: Create Initial Project Directory Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the complete directory structure for all microservices, shared libraries, infrastructure configurations, and documentation as defined in CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md.
# Details:
1. Create the root project directory with appropriate naming convention.

2. Create the following top-level directories:
   - `/microservices` - For all service-specific code
   - `/shared` - For shared libraries and utilities
   - `/infrastructure` - For Kubernetes, Docker, and deployment configurations
   - `/docs` - For project documentation
   - `/scripts` - For utility scripts
   - `/tests` - For integration and end-to-end tests

3. Within `/microservices`, create subdirectories for all 20+ services including:
   - `/microservices/authentication-service`
   - `/microservices/gis-data-service`
   - `/microservices/sensor-data-service`
   - `/microservices/scada-integration-service`
   - `/microservices/ai-model-service`
   - `/microservices/water-distribution-control-service`
   - `/microservices/notification-service`
   - `/microservices/reporting-service`
   - `/microservices/file-processing-service`
   - `/microservices/graphql-api-service`
   - `/microservices/maintenance-service`
   - `/microservices/data-integration-service`
   - `/microservices/configuration-service`
   - `/microservices/bff-service`
   - ... (remaining services as per CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md)

4. For each microservice directory, create language-specific structure:
   - For Java/Spring Boot services:
     ```
     /service-name
       /src
         /main
           /java/com/company/service
             /controllers
             /services
             /repositories
             /models
             /config
           /resources
             /application.yml
         /test
       /build.gradle or pom.xml
       /Dockerfile
       /README.md
     ```
   - For Node.js services:
     ```
     /service-name
       /src
         /controllers
         /services
         /models
         /middleware
         /utils
       /tests
       /package.json
       /Dockerfile
       /README.md
     ```
   - For Python services:
     ```
     /service-name
       /app
         /api
         /core
         /models
         /services
         /utils
       /tests
       /requirements.txt
       /Dockerfile
       /README.md
     ```

5. In the `/shared` directory, create:
   - `/shared/libraries` - For common code libraries
   - `/shared/models` - For shared data models
   - `/shared/utils` - For utility functions
   - `/shared/constants` - For system-wide constants

6. In the `/infrastructure` directory, create:
   - `/infrastructure/kubernetes` - For K8s manifests
   - `/infrastructure/docker` - For Docker Compose files
   - `/infrastructure/terraform` - For IaC
   - `/infrastructure/monitoring` - For monitoring configurations
   - `/infrastructure/ci-cd` - For CI/CD pipeline configurations

7. In the `/docs` directory, create:
   - `/docs/architecture` - For architecture diagrams and descriptions
   - `/docs/api` - For API documentation
   - `/docs/development` - For development guidelines
   - `/docs/operations` - For operational procedures

8. Create placeholder README.md files in each directory with basic descriptions.

9. Create a .gitignore file at the root with appropriate patterns for each language and framework.

10. Create a CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md file at the root that documents the entire directory structure for reference.

11. Ensure all directories follow consistent naming conventions (kebab-case recommended).

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all directories specified in CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md have been created with the correct structure and naming conventions.

2. Run a script to validate the directory structure against the specification:
   ```bash
   find . -type d | sort > actual_structure.txt
   diff expected_structure.txt actual_structure.txt
   ```

3. Ensure each microservice directory contains the appropriate language-specific structure:
   - Check that Java services have proper Maven/Gradle structure
   - Verify Node.js services have the correct npm package structure
   - Confirm Python services follow the defined module structure

4. Validate that all README.md files exist and contain basic descriptive content.

5. Verify the .gitignore file contains appropriate patterns for all used languages and frameworks.

6. Ensure all directory and file names follow the project's naming conventions (kebab-case).

7. Have a team member review the structure to confirm it matches the architectural requirements.

8. Attempt to initialize a git repository in the root directory and verify that the structure can be committed without errors.

9. Verify that placeholder files are properly formatted and don't contain syntax errors.

10. Check that the CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md file accurately reflects the actual implemented directory structure.
