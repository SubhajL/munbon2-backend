# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement SCADA Integration Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the SCADA Integration Service for communication with GE iFix SCADA systems and real-time data acquisition.
# Details:
Implement OPC UA client using Eclipse Milo (v0.6+) or NodeOPCUA for Java/Node.js respectively. Develop integration with GE iFix SCADA using vendor-specific SDKs. Implement data transformation and normalization pipelines. Set up WebSocket server for real-time SCADA updates using Socket.IO or native WebSockets. Implement failover and redundancy handling with circuit breakers. Create control command execution APIs with proper validation. Use Kafka for event sourcing of SCADA operations. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms. Consider implementing a digital twin model of the SCADA system for testing and simulation.

# Test Strategy:
Test OPC UA communication with simulated SCADA endpoints. Validate data transformation pipelines. Test WebSocket streaming functionality. Verify control command execution with mock SCADA systems. Test failover scenarios. Benchmark real-time data acquisition performance. Validate security of SCADA communications.
