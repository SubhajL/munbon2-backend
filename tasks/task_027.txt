# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Weather Integration Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a microservice for integrating with external weather APIs, processing weather data, providing weather forecasts, and managing weather-based alerts for irrigation optimization.
# Details:
1. Architecture and Setup:
   - Create a Spring Boot (v3.0+) or Node.js (v18+) microservice with modular architecture
   - Containerize the service using Docker following best practices from Task 2
   - Configure service discovery and registration with the API Gateway from Task 3
   - Set up Kafka consumers and producers for event-driven communication

2. External API Integration:
   - Implement adapter patterns for multiple weather data sources:
     - Thai Meteorological Department API
     - OpenWeatherMap API
     - Add extension points for future providers
   - Create resilient HTTP clients with circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries
   - Implement API key management and rotation strategy
   - Set up caching layer to minimize external API calls

3. Data Processing Pipeline:
   - Design data models for normalized weather information
   - Implement ETL processes to transform provider-specific data to internal model
   - Create geospatial indexing for location-based queries
   - Implement time-series data storage using appropriate database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB)
   - Set up data aggregation for different time intervals (hourly, daily, weekly forecasts)

4. Forecast Service:
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints for weather queries
   - Create forecast models based on historical and current data
   - Develop algorithms for local microclimate adjustments
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed forecasts

5. Alert Management:
   - Design alert rules engine for configurable thresholds
   - Implement Kafka producers to publish weather events and alerts
   - Create notification templates for different alert types
   - Develop priority-based alert routing

6. Irrigation Optimization:
   - Implement algorithms to calculate optimal irrigation schedules based on:
     - Precipitation forecasts
     - Temperature trends
     - Soil moisture predictions
     - Crop water requirements
   - Create API endpoints for irrigation recommendations

7. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Set up metrics collection for API calls, processing times, and alert triggers
   - Create health check endpoints
   - Configure distributed tracing

8. Documentation:
   - Create API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Document integration patterns for other microservices
   - Provide examples for common weather data queries

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all service components
   - Mock external API responses for predictable testing
   - Test data transformation logic with various input scenarios
   - Verify alert rule engine with different threshold configurations
   - Test irrigation optimization algorithms with various weather conditions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up integration tests with test containers
   - Verify Kafka message production and consumption
   - Test database interactions and query performance
   - Validate API Gateway integration
   - Test resilience patterns with simulated failures

3. API Contract Testing:
   - Implement consumer-driven contract tests
   - Verify OpenAPI specification compliance
   - Test backward compatibility for API changes

4. External API Testing:
   - Create sandbox environments for external API testing
   - Implement replay mechanisms for testing with recorded API responses
   - Test API key rotation and authentication mechanisms
   - Verify error handling for various API failure scenarios

5. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark data processing pipeline
   - Test concurrent request handling
   - Verify caching effectiveness
   - Measure response times under various loads
   - Test database query performance with large datasets

6. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create automated E2E tests for critical user journeys
   - Test weather data flow from external APIs to irrigation recommendations
   - Verify alert generation and notification delivery

7. Chaos Testing:
   - Simulate network partitions and latency
   - Test service behavior during Kafka outages
   - Verify recovery after database unavailability

8. Acceptance Testing:
   - Validate weather data accuracy against known historical data
   - Verify forecast quality with historical comparisons
   - Test irrigation recommendations against expert knowledge
   - Validate alert generation timing and accuracy
