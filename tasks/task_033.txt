# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Configuration Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 11, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a microservice for centralized configuration management that provides feature flags, dynamic configuration updates, environment-specific settings, and configuration versioning for all microservices.
# Details:
1. Architecture and Design:
   - Design a RESTful API for configuration management with endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Implement a hierarchical configuration model (global, service-specific, environment-specific)
   - Create a schema validation system for configuration entries
   - Design a versioning system for configuration changes with rollback capability

2. Core Functionality:
   - Implement feature flag management with boolean, numeric, string, and JSON value types
   - Develop dynamic configuration updates with push notifications to subscribed services
   - Create environment-specific configuration overrides (dev, staging, production)
   - Build a configuration history and audit log system
   - Implement configuration inheritance and override mechanisms

3. Storage and Caching:
   - Use MongoDB as the primary storage for configuration data with appropriate schemas
   - Implement Redis caching layer for high-performance configuration retrieval
   - Design a cache invalidation strategy for configuration updates
   - Set up data replication and backup strategies

4. Integration:
   - Create client libraries in multiple languages (Node.js, Java, Python, Go) for service integration
   - Implement webhook notifications for configuration changes
   - Expose configuration through the API Gateway with proper authentication
   - Develop a configuration change propagation mechanism with health checks

5. Security:
   - Implement role-based access control for configuration management
   - Create encryption for sensitive configuration values
   - Set up audit logging for all configuration changes
   - Implement validation rules to prevent misconfiguration

6. User Interface:
   - Develop an admin dashboard for configuration management
   - Create visualization for configuration dependencies and impact analysis
   - Implement configuration comparison views between environments
   - Build a configuration search and filtering system

7. Deployment:
   - Containerize the service using Docker with appropriate resource limits
   - Configure Kubernetes deployment manifests with proper health checks
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
   - Implement graceful shutdown and startup procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all configuration service components
   - Test configuration validation logic with valid and invalid inputs
   - Verify versioning system correctly tracks and retrieves historical configurations
   - Test feature flag evaluation logic with different conditions

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify MongoDB integration with CRUD operations for configurations
   - Test Redis caching layer for performance and correctness
   - Validate API Gateway integration with proper routing and authentication
   - Test client libraries in different programming languages

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark configuration retrieval latency under various loads
   - Test system performance during configuration updates with multiple subscribers
   - Measure cache hit/miss ratios and optimize accordingly
   - Verify system can handle the expected number of configuration requests per second

4. Security Testing:
   - Verify role-based access controls prevent unauthorized configuration access
   - Test encryption/decryption of sensitive configuration values
   - Validate audit logging captures all configuration changes accurately
   - Perform penetration testing on the configuration API endpoints

5. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create test scenarios that simulate real-world configuration management workflows
   - Verify configuration changes propagate correctly to dependent services
   - Test rollback functionality for configuration versions
   - Validate environment-specific configuration overrides work as expected

6. Chaos Testing:
   - Test system resilience when MongoDB or Redis temporarily fails
   - Verify configuration service behavior during network partitions
   - Test recovery procedures after simulated outages
   - Validate fallback mechanisms when configuration service is unavailable

7. Acceptance Testing:
   - Verify the admin dashboard correctly displays and allows editing of configurations
   - Test the user experience for common configuration management tasks
   - Validate that all requirements are met through user acceptance testing
   - Document any issues or improvements for future iterations
