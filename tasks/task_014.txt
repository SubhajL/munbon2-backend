# Title: Setup Redis for Caching and Sessions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up and configure Redis for caching, session management, and real-time features.
# Details:
Deploy Redis (v7.0+) on Kubernetes using Redis Operator. Configure Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster for high availability. Set up proper persistence configuration. Implement cache eviction policies. Configure connection pooling. Set up Redis for session storage with appropriate TTL. Implement Redis Streams for lightweight messaging. Configure Redis for rate limiting. Consider using Redis Enterprise or managed Redis services if available in Thailand region.

# Test Strategy:
Validate Redis setup with connection tests. Test high availability with failover scenarios. Verify persistence configuration. Benchmark cache performance under load. Test session management functionality. Validate rate limiting capabilities. Test Redis Streams functionality.
