# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement RID API Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 48
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an API integration service for Royal Irrigation Department that connects to three specific RID APIs: telemetry data API for real-time sensor readings, rainfall data API for precipitation measurements, and Dam/reservoir data API for water storage levels and releases.
# Details:
Build RID API integration service using Node.js/TypeScript with Express.js. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for accessing the three RID APIs. Create separate modules for each API integration: 1) Telemetry data API for real-time sensor readings, 2) Rainfall data API for precipitation measurements, and 3) Dam/reservoir data API for water storage levels and releases. Implement rate limiting specific to each RID API's usage patterns. Create data filtering based on access permissions. Implement request/response logging for compliance. Add data normalization to standardize information from all three sources. Create webhook endpoints for event notifications. Implement circuit breakers for system failures. Add response caching for frequently requested data. Support both REST and SOAP protocols as needed for legacy compatibility. Create comprehensive API documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Test OAuth authentication with RID credentials for all three APIs. Verify successful data retrieval from telemetry, rainfall, and dam/reservoir APIs. Test data normalization across all three data sources. Validate rate limiting effectiveness for each API. Test error handling when any of the three RID APIs are unavailable. Verify circuit breaker functionality. Test data caching mechanisms. Validate webhook functionality for real-time updates. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all three integration points.
