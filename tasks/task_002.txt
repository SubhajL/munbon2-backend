# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Docker Containerization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Docker containers for all microservices with optimized images and security best practices.
# Details:
Create multi-stage Dockerfiles for each microservice to minimize image size. Use distroless or Alpine-based images (latest stable versions) for security. Implement container security best practices including non-root users, read-only filesystems, and resource limits. Set up Docker Compose for local development. Configure container health checks. Use Docker BuildKit for efficient builds. Implement proper tagging strategy for versioning. Consider using Buildah/Podman for OCI-compliant container builds. Scan images for vulnerabilities using Trivy, Clair, or Snyk.

# Test Strategy:
Validate Dockerfiles with hadolint. Test container builds in CI pipeline. Verify container security with Docker Bench. Run vulnerability scans on all images. Test container startup and health checks. Validate multi-architecture support if needed.
