# Flow Monitoring - Parallel Development Strategy

## YES - All Instances Can Run in Parallel!

### Parallel Development Plan

#### Instance 16: Core Monitoring (No waiting required)
**Build First:**
- Hydraulic solver with gate equations
- Dual-mode control logic
- Mode transition system

**Provide Mock APIs Immediately:**
```python
# mock_hydraulics.py
@app.post("/api/v1/hydraulics/verify-schedule")
async def mock_verify_schedule(schedule: dict):
    return {
        "feasible": True,
        "water_levels": {"M(0,0)": 219.2, "M(0,2)": 218.9},
        "warnings": []
    }

@app.get("/api/v1/gates/state")
async def mock_gate_state():
    return {
        "gates": {
            "Source->M(0,0)": {
                "type": "automated",
                "opening_m": 1.8,
                "flow_m3s": 4.5
            }
        }
    }
```

#### Instance 17: Scheduler + Field App (No waiting required)
**Build First:**
- Schedule optimization algorithms
- Mobile app with offline sync
- Field instruction generator

**Use Mock Hydraulics:**
```python
# Use Instance 16's mock APIs
hydraulics_response = httpx.post(
    "http://localhost:3011/api/v1/hydraulics/verify-schedule",
    json=schedule
)
# Continue with mock response
```

**Provide Mock APIs:**
```python
@app.get("/api/v1/schedule/week/{week}")
async def mock_schedule(week: str):
    return {
        "week": week,
        "operations": [
            {
                "day": "Tuesday",
                "gates": ["Source->M(0,0)", "M(0,0)->M(0,2)"],
                "volumes": {"Zone_2": 75000}
            }
        ]
    }
```

#### Instance 18: ROS/GIS Integration (No waiting required)
**Build First:**
- Section demand aggregation
- Spatial mapping logic
- Priority resolution

**Provide Mock Demands:**
```python
@app.get("/api/v1/demands/week/{week}")
async def mock_demands(week: str):
    return {
        "sections": [
            {
                "section_id": "Zone_2_Section_A",
                "demand_m3": 15000,
                "crop": "rice",
                "priority": 9
            }
        ]
    }
```

## API Contract Agreement

All instances agree on these contracts from Day 1:

### Shared Types
```python
# shared_types.py (all instances use this)
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from datetime import datetime

class GateState(BaseModel):
    gate_id: str
    type: str  # "automated" | "manual"
    opening_m: float
    flow_m3s: float
    last_updated: datetime

class SectionDemand(BaseModel):
    section_id: str
    zone: int
    demand_m3: float
    priority: int
    crop_type: str
    delivery_window: Dict[str, datetime]

class ScheduleOperation(BaseModel):
    gate_id: str
    action: str  # "open" | "close" | "adjust"
    target_opening_m: float
    scheduled_time: datetime
    team_assigned: Optional[str]
```

## Development Timeline

### Weeks 1-3: Parallel Development
- All instances build core features
- Use mock APIs for integration points
- Daily sync on API contract changes

### Week 4: Integration Week
- Replace mocks with real endpoints
- Integration testing
- Performance tuning

### Week 5: System Testing
- End-to-end scenarios
- Field testing with mobile app
- Load testing

## Benefits of Parallel Approach

1. **3x Faster Development**: All teams work simultaneously
2. **Early Integration Testing**: Mock APIs enable early testing
3. **API Design Validation**: Contracts tested before implementation
4. **Risk Reduction**: Issues found early through mocks
5. **Independent Progress**: No team blocked by another

## Mock Server Setup

Create a shared mock server for development:

```python
# mock_server.py - Run on port 3099
from fastapi import FastAPI
import random

app = FastAPI(title="Flow Monitoring Mock Server")

# Include all mock endpoints from all instances
# This allows any instance to test against full system

@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {
        "services": {
            "core_monitoring": "mocked",
            "scheduler": "mocked", 
            "ros_gis_integration": "mocked"
        }
    }
```

## Coordination Points

1. **API Contract Repository**: Shared Git repo for contracts
2. **Mock Server**: Centralized mocks for all services
3. **Daily Standup**: 15-min sync on API changes
4. **Integration Tests**: Shared test scenarios
5. **Documentation**: Keep contracts in sync

This parallel approach reduces the 5-week sequential timeline to just 3 weeks of parallel work + 2 weeks integration!
