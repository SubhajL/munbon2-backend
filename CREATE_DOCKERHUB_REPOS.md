# Quick Docker Hub Repository Creation

## You need to create these repositories on Docker Hub first!

The error "repository name component must match" means the repositories don't exist yet on Docker Hub.

## Create these 3 repositories first (for testing):

1. Go to https://hub.docker.com/repositories
2. Click "Create Repository" for each:
   - Repository name: `munbon-sensor-data`
   - Repository name: `munbon-auth`  
   - Repository name: `munbon-gis`

## Important:
- Just type the repository name (e.g., `munbon-sensor-data`)
- Don't include your username - it's automatic
- Make them Public (free plan)

## After creating, you should have:
- subhaj888/munbon-sensor-data
- subhaj888/munbon-auth
- subhaj888/munbon-gis

## Quick Test:
Once created, the workflow should be able to push to these repositories.
