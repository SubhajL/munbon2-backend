# Current System Status Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Dual-Write Implementation ✅
- Implemented dual-write capability for sensor data (water level and moisture)
- Data is written to both local TimescaleDB (port 5433) and AWS EC2 database
- Configuration:
  - Local: localhost:5433 (munbon_timescale)
  - EC2: 43.209.22.250:5432 (sensor_data)
  - Password: P@ssw0rd123!

### 2. Data Consistency Fixes ✅
- Fixed timestamp parsing issues that caused worker to stop at 08:00 UTC
- Implemented auto-registration for sensors to handle foreign key constraints
- Added robust error handling and retry logic for EC2 writes

### 3. GIS Data Enhancement ✅
- Added area_rai column to agricultural_plots table (calculated as area_hectares * 6.25)
- Successfully imported 15,069 parcels from merge3Amp GeoPackage to ros.plots table
- Corrected zone assignments based on sub_member field:
  - Zone 1: 2,945 parcels (8,137.00 rai)
  - Zone 2: 2,468 parcels (8,465.96 rai)
  - Zone 3: 1,980 parcels (6,469.81 rai)
  - Zone 4: 4,624 parcels (11,570.95 rai)
  - Zone 5: 1,762 parcels (4,939.44 rai)
  - Zone 6: 1,290 parcels (4,876.71 rai)

## Current Data Status
- Water Level: 8,735 records (last: 2025-08-04 07:03:55)
- Moisture: 1,197 records (last: 2025-08-04 04:46:41)
- No recent data in the last hour - appears sensors are not actively sending data

## Active Services
- Sensor Data API: Running on port 3000
- SQS Consumer: Running on port 3004 (processing from AWS SQS queue)
- Dual-write: ENABLED

## Next Steps (Pending)
1. Port water level data ingestion service to EC2
2. Port moisture data ingestion service to EC2
3. Implement packet validation for moisture data
4. Add structured logging for incoming moisture requests
5. Create monitoring dashboard for moisture data flow
6. Evaluate moisture data flow: HTTP API direct write vs SQS queue

## Known Issues
- EC2 database connection may have authentication issues (need to verify credentials)
- No recent sensor data being received (last data from August 4th)
