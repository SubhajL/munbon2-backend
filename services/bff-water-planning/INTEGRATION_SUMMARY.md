# Water Planning BFF Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Water Level Data Integration
- ✅ Created migration for water level data tables
- ✅ Implemented WaterLevelClient service
- ✅ Updated daily demand calculator to include water level data
- ✅ Added water level considerations to demand calculations

### 2. Unified Mock Server
- ✅ Created comprehensive mock server at port 3099
- ✅ Implemented mock endpoints for all required services:
  - ROS (Reservoir Operation Study)
  - GIS (Geographic Information System)
  - AWD (Alternate Wetting and Drying)
  - Sensor Data (Water levels and moisture)
  - Flow Monitoring
  - Scheduler
  - Weather

### 3. Service Client Updates
- ✅ Updated all service clients to support mock server mode
- ✅ Added new clients for:
  - Flow Monitoring
  - Scheduler
  - Weather
- ✅ Configured environment-based switching between mock and real services

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Created integration test script
- ✅ Created startup script for running with mock server
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## How to Use

### Development with Mock Server

1. **Start both services:**
   ```bash
   cd services/bff-water-planning
   ./start_with_mock.sh
   ```

2. **Run integration tests:**
   ```bash
   python test_mock_integration.py
   ```

3. **Access services:**
   - Mock Server API Docs: http://localhost:3099/docs
   - BFF GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:3022/graphql

### Configuration

The BFF service automatically uses the mock server when `USE_MOCK_SERVER=true` is set in the `.env` file.

### Key Features Added

1. **Water Level Integration**
   - Real-time water level data from sensors
   - Historical water level analysis
   - Water level-based demand adjustments

2. **Mock Server Benefits**
   - Single server for all external dependencies
   - Consistent, realistic test data
   - Fast development without external service dependencies
   - Interactive API documentation

3. **Enhanced Service Clients**
   - Automatic mock/real service switching
   - Consistent error handling
   - Timeout configuration
   - Structured logging

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Planning Algorithms**
   - ET-based planning
   - Water allocation optimization
   - Scenario analysis

2. **Build GraphQL Resolvers**
   - Irrigation plan creation
   - Water demand forecasting
   - Optimization endpoints

3. **Add Planning Features**
   - Seasonal planning workflows
   - Daily plan updates
   - Conflict resolution

4. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end planning scenarios
   - Performance testing
   - Error handling validation
