# Scripts Status - August 2, 2025

## Available Scripts

### 1. Network Traffic Analysis
**File**: `network-traffic-analysis.sh`
**Status**: ✅ Ready to use
**Purpose**: Deep packet-level analysis to prove if data is being sent
**Usage**: 
```bash
./network-traffic-analysis.sh
```

### 2. Manufacturer Verification Test
**File**: `manufacturer-verification-test.sh`  
**Status**: ✅ Ready to use (needs chmod +x)
**Purpose**: Provides test script manufacturer can run to prove connectivity
**Usage**:
```bash
chmod +x manufacturer-verification-test.sh
./manufacturer-verification-test.sh
```

### 3. Forensic HTTP Server
**File**: `src/forensic-http-server.ts`
**Status**: ❌ Has TypeScript errors, but core HTTP server works
**Alternative**: Current `moisture-http` server is running and logging

## Key Findings from Network Analysis

1. **30-second packet capture**: 
   - 0 external POST requests to moisture endpoint
   - Only 1 external packet total (vs 1133 internal Kubernetes packets)
   
2. **Endpoint is accessible**:
   - Health check works: `curl http://43.209.22.250:8080/health`
   - Moisture endpoint responds to test data

3. **Database shows sporadic data**:
   - Only 13 readings in 7 days from gateway 0003
   - Average gap: 2 hours (max: 14 hours)
   - This is 0.6% of "continuous" transmission

## Conclusion
The manufacturer is NOT sending continuous data. Our endpoint is working correctly and accessible from the internet.
