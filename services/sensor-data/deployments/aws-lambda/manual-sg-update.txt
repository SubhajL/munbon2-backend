Manual Security Group Update Instructions:

1. If this is an AWS EC2 instance:
   - Go to AWS Console > EC2 > Security Groups
   - Find the security group attached to your instance
   - Add inbound rule:
     * Type: PostgreSQL
     * Port: 5432
     * Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (or restrict to Lambda IP ranges)

2. If this is a non-AWS VPS/Cloud instance:
   - Check firewall rules (ufw, iptables, etc.)
   - Allow incoming connections on port 5432
   - Example for ufw:
     sudo ufw allow 5432/tcp
     sudo ufw reload
