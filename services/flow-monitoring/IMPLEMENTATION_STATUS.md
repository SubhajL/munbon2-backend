# Flow Monitoring Service - Implementation Status

## Overview
The Core Flow Monitoring Service with Dual-Mode Control has been implemented for the Munbon Irrigation Backend project. This service provides the foundation for both real-time automated control and weekly batch manual operations.

## Service Details
- **Port**: 3011
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Purpose**: Core hydraulic monitoring and gate control with dual-mode support

## Implemented Features

### 1. API Endpoints

#### Gate Control Endpoints (`/api/v1/gates/*`)
- **GET /api/v1/gates/state** - Get current state of all gates
  - Returns operational mode, opening percentage, flow rate, and control status
  - Includes calibration parameters and location information
  
- **GET /api/v1/gates/state/{gate_id}** - Get state of specific gate
  
- **PUT /api/v1/gates/manual/{gate_id}/state** - Update manual gate state
  - Used by field teams to report actual gate positions
  - Validates gate is in manual mode before accepting updates
  
- **POST /api/v1/gates/mode/transition** - Request mode transition
  - Handles validation and safe transition procedures
  - Supports force transitions with appropriate warnings
  
- **GET /api/v1/gates/manual/instructions** - Get manual operation instructions
  - Generates optimized instructions for field teams
  - Considers automated gate states for coordination
  
- **GET /api/v1/gates/synchronization/status** - Check sync status
  - Reports synchronization quality between manual/automated operations

#### Hydraulic Verification Endpoints (`/api/v1/hydraulics/*`)
- **POST /api/v1/hydraulics/verify-schedule** - Verify irrigation schedule feasibility
  - Checks water availability and delivery constraints
  - Validates system capacity with safety margins
  - Returns required gate settings and violation details

### 2. Dual-Mode Gate Controller
- Supports automated (SCADA), manual, hybrid, maintenance, and failed modes
- Seamless mode transitions with validation
- Conflict detection between automated and manual operations
- State tracking and synchronization

### 3. Hydraulic Integration
- Calibrated gate flow equations: Q = Cs × L × Hs × √(2g × ΔH)
- Integration with existing hydraulic solver
- Path-based flow calculations
- Travel time computations

### 4. Key Technical Features
- Asynchronous operation with proper locking for mode transitions
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Structured logging with structlog
- Database integration (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Kafka consumer for real-time data

## Testing
- Test script provided: `test_api.py`
- Tests against both mock server (port 3099) and actual service
- Covers all critical endpoints

## Configuration
Environment variables required (see `.env` file):
- Database connections (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Kafka configuration
- Service settings

## Next Steps for Other Instances

### Instance 17 (Scheduler) can now:
- Call GET /api/v1/gates/state to get current gate states
- Submit schedules to POST /api/v1/hydraulics/verify-schedule
- Update manual gates via PUT /api/v1/gates/manual/{gate_id}/state

### Instance 18 (ROS/GIS) can now:
- Query gate states for spatial visualization
- Submit demand-based schedules for verification
- Monitor real-time flow conditions
