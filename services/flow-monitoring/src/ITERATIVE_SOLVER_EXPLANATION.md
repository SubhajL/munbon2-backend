# YES - The Iterative Water Level ↔ Flow Rate Computation

## Your Understanding is EXACTLY Right!

The solver performs this circular computation:

```
Water Levels → Flow Rates → Water Levels → Flow Rates → ... → Convergence
     ↑                                                              ↓
     └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## The Iterative Process in Detail:

### Iteration 1:
```
1. START with initial water levels at ALL nodes:
   - Source: 221.0m
   - M(0,0): 219.0m (assumed)
   - M(0,2): 218.9m (assumed)
   - M(0,3): 218.8m (assumed)
   - ... all nodes have levels

2. COMPUTE flow rates through ALL gates using these levels:
   - Q[Source→M(0,0)] = f(221.0m, 219.0m, gate_opening)
   - Q[M(0,0)→M(0,2)] = f(219.0m, 218.9m, gate_opening)
   - Q[M(0,2)→M(0,3)] = f(218.9m, 218.8m, gate_opening)
   - ... compute for all gates

3. UPDATE water levels at ALL nodes based on flow continuity:
   - For each node: Σ(inflows) - Σ(outflows) = change in storage
   - Adjust water level based on imbalance
```

### Iteration 2:
```
4. With NEW water levels, RECOMPUTE all flow rates:
   - Source: 221.0m (fixed)
   - M(0,0): 219.2m (updated) ← CHANGED!
   - M(0,2): 218.7m (updated) ← CHANGED!
   
5. New flows:
   - Q[Source→M(0,0)] = f(221.0m, 219.2m, gate_opening) ← DIFFERENT!
   - Q[M(0,0)→M(0,2)] = f(219.2m, 218.7m, gate_opening) ← DIFFERENT!
```

### Continue Until Convergence:
```
Iteration 3: Levels change less → Flows change less
Iteration 4: Even smaller changes
...
Iteration N: Changes < tolerance → CONVERGED!
```

## Visual Example of One Iteration:

```
STEP 1: Current Water Levels (all nodes)
========================================
Source: 221.00m ─┐
                 ├─ ΔH = 2.00m
M(0,0): 219.00m ─┘
                 ├─ ΔH = 0.10m  
M(0,2): 218.90m ─┘
                 ├─ ΔH = 0.10m
M(0,3): 218.80m ─┘

STEP 2: Calculate Flows (all gates)
===================================
Q[Source→M(0,0)] = Cd × A × √(2g × 2.00) = 4.5 m³/s
Q[M(0,0)→M(0,2)] = Cd × A × √(2g × 0.10) = 4.5 m³/s  
Q[M(0,2)→M(0,3)] = Cd × A × √(2g × 0.10) = 4.5 m³/s

STEP 3: Check Continuity (all nodes)
====================================
At M(0,0): IN: 4.5  OUT: 4.5  Balance: 0 ✓
At M(0,2): IN: 4.5  OUT: 4.5  Balance: 0 ✓
At M(0,3): IN: 4.5  OUT: 4.5  Balance: 0 ✓

If not balanced → Adjust levels → Return to STEP 1
```

## The Key Insight:

You CANNOT compute flow without knowing water levels, but water levels depend on flows!

This is why we need iteration:
- **Initial guess** → water levels at all nodes
- **Compute** → flows through all gates  
- **Update** → water levels based on flow balance
- **Repeat** → until levels stop changing

## Code Implementation:

```python
while not converged:
    # 1. Calculate ALL gate flows based on current levels
    for gate_id in self.gates:
        upstream, downstream = self.gates[gate_id]
        h_up = self.water_levels[upstream]      # Current level
        h_down = self.water_levels[downstream]   # Current level
        self.flows[gate_id] = calculate_flow(h_up, h_down, opening)
    
    # 2. Update ALL node levels based on flow continuity
    for node in self.nodes:
        inflow = sum(flows INTO node)
        outflow = sum(flows OUT of node)
        imbalance = inflow - outflow
        
        # Adjust water level
        self.water_levels[node] += imbalance * dt / area
    
    # 3. Check if levels stabilized
    if max_level_change < tolerance:
        converged = True
```

## Why This Works:

1. **Physics-based**: Mimics how real water systems reach equilibrium
2. **Self-correcting**: Errors reduce with each iteration
3. **Guaranteed solution**: For well-posed problems, will converge

## What Happens Without Iteration:

If you try to solve without iteration:
```
ERROR: To find Q, need H... but to find H, need Q!
```

The iteration breaks this circular dependency by:
- Starting with a reasonable guess
- Gradually refining both Q and H together
- Reaching a consistent solution where both satisfy physics

Your understanding is PERFECT - the solver continuously updates water levels at ALL nodes, uses those to compute flows through ALL gates, then updates levels again, repeating until equilibrium!
