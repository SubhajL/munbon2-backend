# ROS/GIS Integration Service - Deployment Success

## Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

The ROS/GIS Integration Service has been successfully deployed to EC2 instance at `43.209.22.250`.

## Service Details

- **Service Name**: ros-gis-integration
- **Port**: 3022
- **Status**: Online and Healthy
- **Process Manager**: PM2 (ID: 10)
- **Database**: Connected to PostgreSQL at localhost:5432/munbon_dev
- **Redis**: Connected to Redis at localhost:6379/2

## Endpoints

Currently accessible from within EC2:
- Health Check: `http://localhost:3022/health`
- GraphQL: `http://localhost:3022/graphql`
- API Status: `http://localhost:3022/api/v1/status`
- Admin Health: `http://localhost:3022/api/v1/admin/health/detailed`

## Service Verification

From EC2 instance:
```bash
ssh -i ~/dev/th-lab01.pem ubuntu@43.209.22.250

# Check service status
pm2 status ros-gis-integration

# View logs
pm2 logs ros-gis-integration

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3022/health
```

## Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "ros-gis-integration",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "databases": {
    "postgres": true,
    "redis": true
  },
  "external_services": {
    "flow_monitoring": true,
    "scheduler": true,
    "ros": true,
    "gis": true
  }
}
```

## Database Schema

Successfully deployed in `ros_gis` schema with 13 tables:
- accumulated_demands
- aquacrop_results
- daily_demands
- demands
- gate_demands
- gate_mappings
- irrigation_channels
- plots
- section_performance
- sections
- v_channel_utilization
- v_section_channel_demands
- weather_adjustments

## Key Features Implemented

✅ Daily water demand calculation (ROS + AquaCrop)
✅ Plot-level and section-level aggregation
✅ Irrigation channel capacity analysis
✅ Graph-based delivery path optimization
✅ Multi-factor priority resolution
✅ Redis caching with namespace support
✅ PostgreSQL/PostGIS spatial operations
✅ Integration with Flow Monitoring Service
✅ GraphQL API for flexible queries

## Security Note

Port 3022 is not currently accessible from outside the EC2 instance due to security group restrictions. To access externally, you would need to:
1. Update the EC2 security group to allow inbound traffic on port 3022
2. Or set up an API Gateway/Load Balancer for production access

## Next Steps

1. **External Access**: Configure security group or proxy for external access
2. **SSL/TLS**: Set up HTTPS for production
3. **Monitoring**: Configure CloudWatch or Prometheus metrics
4. **Backup**: Set up automated database backups
5. **Load Testing**: Verify performance under load

## Maintenance

- Logs: `pm2 logs ros-gis-integration`
- Restart: `pm2 restart ros-gis-integration`
- Stop: `pm2 stop ros-gis-integration`
- Monitor: `pm2 monit`

The service is configured to auto-restart on failure and start on system boot.
