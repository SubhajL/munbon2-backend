# Real Network Data Import Complete

## Summary
Successfully imported real canal network data from Flow Monitoring service into Gravity Optimizer database.

## Import Statistics

### Network Elements
- **Hydraulic Nodes**: 60 (including Source)
- **Channels**: 68 (67 regular + 1 source connection)
- **Channel Sections**: 67 (one per channel)
- **Gates**: 59 (20 automated, 39 manual)
- **Zones**: 6 irrigation zones

### Channel Connections
- **Connected Gates**: 
  - 55 gates have upstream channel connections
  - 51 gates have downstream channel connections
  - 48 gates are fully connected (both upstream and downstream)
- **Network Topology**: Successfully extracted from Flow Monitoring's 69 edge connections

### Data Sources
1. **Network Structure**: `/services/flow-monitoring/src/munbon_network_complete.json`
   - 59 gates with hierarchy and zone assignments
   - 69 edge connections defining the network topology

2. **Canal Geometry**: `/services/flow-monitoring/src/scada_characteristics_raw.csv`
   - 39km of canal sections
   - Bed widths, depths, Manning's n values, slopes

3. **Elevation Data**: 
   - 8 known control points from hydraulic model
   - Interpolated elevations for remaining nodes based on canal slopes

## Channel ID Mapping
To comply with database constraints (50 char limit), channels are assigned short IDs:
- `CH_000`: Source to Outlet channel
- `CH_001` to `CH_067`: Regular network channels
- Channel names preserve full gate connection details

## Key Improvements
1. **Channel Connections**: Created 67 channels from network edge data
2. **Gate Connectivity**: Each gate knows its upstream/downstream channels
3. **Shorter IDs**: Fixed varchar(50) constraint issue with generated channel IDs
4. **Network Validation**: Identified 13 dead-end channels and 1 disconnected node

## Next Steps
1. Update Gravity Optimizer service to use real network data
2. Re-validate Zone 5 & 6 elevations (previously flagged as infeasible)
3. Test optimization algorithms with real network topology
4. Integrate with SCADA service for real-time gate control

## Migration Files
- Schema: `scripts/init-db.sql`
- ETL Script: `scripts/port_flow_monitoring_data_v2.py`
- Migration SQL: `scripts/migrations/import_real_network_v2.sql`
- Test Script: `scripts/test_real_network.py`

## Database Connection
```bash
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -U postgres -d munbon_dev -h localhost -p 5434
```

## Service Configuration
The Gravity Optimizer service needs these environment variables:
```bash
GRAVITY_POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
GRAVITY_POSTGRES_PORT=5434
GRAVITY_POSTGRES_DB=munbon_dev
GRAVITY_POSTGRES_USER=postgres
GRAVITY_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
```
