### ‚úÖ Database Connection
- PostgreSQL connection to new IP tested successfully
- Connection string: `postgresql://postgres:P@ssw0rd123!@43.209.22.250:5432`

### üìù Documentation References
The following documentation files contain references to the old IP for historical context only:
1. `EC2_IP_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md` - Documents the migration history
2. `services/awd-control/TEST_RESULTS_REPORT.md` - Contains test results discussing potential scenarios

These documentation references are intentional and do not affect system functionality.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. GitHub Secrets
Please manually verify and update the `EC2_HOST` secret in GitHub repository settings to `43.209.22.250`.

### 2. External Services
Any external services or Lambda functions that connect to the EC2 instance need to be updated with the new IP.

### 3. Service Restart
If services are currently running on the EC2 instance, they may need to be restarted to pick up the new configuration:
```bash
ssh -i th-lab01.pem ubuntu@43.209.22.250
pm2 restart all
# or
docker-compose restart
```

## Verification Commands

Test database connectivity:
```bash
PGPASSWORD='P@ssw0rd123!' psql -h 43.209.22.250 -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT version();"
```

Test service endpoints:
```bash
curl http://43.209.22.250:3003/health  # Sensor Data API
curl http://43.209.22.250:3004        # Sensor Data Consumer
curl http://43.209.22.250:8080/health  # Moisture HTTP
```

## Conclusion
The IP address update has been successfully completed across all configuration files and scripts. The system is ready to operate with the new EC2 IP address `43.209.22.250`.
