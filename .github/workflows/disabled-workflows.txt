# Disabled Workflows

To reduce confusion and avoid duplicate deployments, the following workflows should be disabled:

1. deploy-ec2-docker.yml - Duplicate of deploy-ec2.yml
2. deploy-aws.yml - ECS deployment (not using ECS)
3. build-and-push.yml - ECR push (not needed for EC2 deployment)

Keep only:
- deploy-ec2.yml - Main EC2 deployment workflow
- docker-build.yml - For CI/CD build verification
- test-aws-connection.yml - Manual testing only
